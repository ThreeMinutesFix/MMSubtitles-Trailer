"Since it is so likely

Another great man
of faith, John Bunyan,

10
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,333
penned these words.

11
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:31,166
"As I walked through the
wilderness of this world,

12
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,916
I lighted on a certain
place where was a den,

13
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:38,041
and laid me down
in that place to sleep.

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,083
And as I slept, I
dreamed a dream.

15
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,458
I dreamed and behold, I saw
a man clothed with rags,

16
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,833
standing in a certain place,

17
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,416
with his face from
his own house,

18
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,958
a book in his hand, and a
great burden upon his back.

19
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:58,708
I looked, and saw him open
the book and read therein;

20
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,416
and as he read, he
wept and trembled;

and not being able
longer to contain,

22

John Bunyan, over
300 years ago,

38
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,375
was in prison for twelve
years because of his faith.

39
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,083
While he was locked
away from his family

40
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,083
in a cold, dark place,

41
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,000
his imagination was stirred

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,875
to write the allegory of
"The Pilgrim's Progress."

43
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,500
Imagination is what
gives us the ability

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,000
to visualize the things
that we cannot see.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,208
It is how we
see, hear, taste,

46
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,666
and smell things that
make up our world,

47
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,750
even when they
are nowhere near us.

48
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,958
To see the creativity
of our God,

49
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:12,333
one only has to look around
at the world in which we live.

50
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,875
The changing
colors and leaves,

51
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:19,041
the way the sun paints the sky
when a day begins and ends.

00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,541
God is creative and created
us to be, as well.

53
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:26,958
Reason, knowledge,
and logic are important.

54
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,250
We need to be inquisitive,

55

ask questions, and
seek to understand.

56
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:34,416
But logic and reason
alone are not enough.

57
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,666
To know about Christ is not
the same as to know Him.

58
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,958
Our faith is not about what we
know. It's about who we know.

59
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,708
Facts set a foundation,

60
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,583
and our imagination
makes those facts

61
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,708
personal to us and
leads our hearts to sing.

62
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,958
As Christians, we
need vivid imaginations.

From Genesis to
the final Revelation,

the Bible paints pictures,

65
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,666
makes analogies,
and uses parables.

66
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,083
It engages our imaginations
to help us understand

67
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,791
what our King wants
us to know about Him,

68
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,833
about us, and
about our journey

69

from this life to the next.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,583
God gave us an imagination
and teaches us with it

71
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,375
and connects with
us through it.

72
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:21,250
Now, children have the ability
to tap into this gift in a way

that we often lose as adults.

in understanding our faith

What was Faithful Pathfinder
thinking, I wonder?

00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:36,000
It has been said that no
one just finds the Book,

but, rather, the
Book finds them.

Christian began to read.

from its pages,

he read the Book all through

and the day after that.

00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,000

more his concern for right
