"A traveler's journey,
Journey to Heaven. "

3
00: 00: 22,800 -> 00: 00: 28,920
Pilgrim's Progress was written in 1675
by John Bunyan

4
00: 00: 29,040 -> 00: 00: 32,520
Detained traders in Bedford, England

5
00: 00: 32,560 -> 00: 00: 34,720
for preaching the Word of GOD

6
00: 00: 34,760 -> 00: 00: 39,880
in prison this is John Bunyan writing

7
00: 00: 39,920 -> 00: 00: 44,800
one of the stories that is loved throughout
period; this story is told through dreams

8
00: 01: 49,120 -> 00: 01: 55,640
"I lay in a place to sleep
and when I sleep "

9
00: 01: 55,720 -> 00: 02: 00,480
"I saw a dream, I saw someone
with a heavy burden behind him reading a book "

10
00: 02: 00,520 -> 00: 02: 06,520
"I saw a vision of that fire
will come, scare a Christian named. "

11
00: 02: 33,480 -> 00: 02: 36,720
Are you still reading the book?

12
00: 02: 38,360 -> 00: 02: 40,800
Yes, many make sense

13
00: 02: 41,080 -> 00: 02: 44,320
You said the book was sad to you

14
00: 02: 44,440 -> 00: 02: 45,760
And you keep reading it ...

15
00: 02: 46,000 -> 00: 02: 48,720
No ... I can't put it down

16
00: 02: 48,760 -> 00: 02: 50,520
So what did you read about today?

17
00: 02: 53,240 -> 00: 02: 57,040
Yes maybe this will sound a little crazy

18
00: 02: 57,520 -> 00: 03: 00,680
said ... and I didn't say
I certainly know the truth

19
00: 03: 02,400 -> 00: 03: 08,760
But today I'm reading our city
destroyed with fire

20
00: 03: 10,400 -> 00: 03: 15,920
And we will all die, except
I can find a way out

21
00: 03: 17,080 -> 00: 03: 21,000
I love you all, more than anything

22
00: 03: 21,680 -> 00: 03: 27,640
And I won't stop until I meet
that shelter, that place

23
00: 03: 27,640 -> 00: 03: 29,800
The place that this book says

24
00: 03: 30,280 -> 00: 03: 32,760
You are right

25
00: 03: 33,400 -> 00: 03: 36,320
That sounds crazy

26
00: 03: 37,360 -> 00: 03: 40,120
Father and I must speak

27
00: 03: 42,880 -> 00: 03: 46,200
You must stop reading the book,

28
00: 03: 46,800 -> 00: 03: 50,640
It's just stories, fantasy, fairy tales

29
00: 03: 50,720 -> 00: 03: 52,760
That is not true

30
00: 03: 53,400 -> 00: 03: 57,720
You question
I'm real?

31
00: 03: 57,960 -> 00: 04: 02,240
real kids, and I don't want you
sad they are with that crazy story.

32
00: 04: 02,280 -> 00: 04: 05,720
my dear, we are safe here

33
00: 04: 06,920 -> 00: 04: 12,600
I won't be able to stand here
and waiting for us to die, listen?

34
00: 04: 13,320 -> 00: 04: 16,960
And this burden is increasing
big, big and big

35
00: 04: 17,800 -> 00: 04: 22,840
I have to find a way to escape
from that and save our family

36
00: 04: 22,920 -> 00: 04: 26,240
That is the truth

37
00: 04: 26,680 -> 00: 04: 29,120
Let us help you
release you from that burden

38
00: 04: 30,200 -> 00: 04: 32,880
I've contacted someone
and I think you can talk ...

39
00: 04: 33,000 -> 00: 04: 36,000
O yes?
Do you think that easy?

40
00: 04: 36,360 -> 00: 04: 38,560
Do you think I like this?

41
00: 04: 39,160 -> 00: 04: 43,080
there are no people in this world
can lift this load

42
00: 04: 45,800 -> 00: 04: 49,080
I gave you a place in the living room

43
00: 04: 49,560 -> 00: 04: 52,320
I think you will be safer there

44
00: 04: 52,480 -> 00: 04: 56,080
I don't want to hear about this anymore!

45
00: 05: 00,920 -> 00: 05: 07,000
"In my dream, I saw a heavy burden
and the vision of destruction in front of ... "

46
00: 05: 07,120 -> 00: 05: 09,600
"Making Christians difficult to sleep"

47
00: 05: 09,720 -> 00: 05: 15,240
"Day after day Christian walks in the yard
study the book "

48
00: 05: 15,440 -> 00: 05: 19,840
"He prayed earnestly that he would
help them all. "

49
00: 05: 20,440 -> 00: 05: 24,600
"In a dream I saw his family
don't listen. "

50
00: 05: 25,520 -> 00: 05: 29,360
"His family refused to open his ears
on the truth. "

51
00: 05: 30,320 -> 00: 05: 35,240
"Like most, their eyes
blinded by this world. "

52
00: 06: 20,160 -> 00: 06: 23,280
What do you want me to do?

53
00: 06: 30,600 -> 00: 06: 33,520
What is your problem?

54
00: 06: 33,680 -> 00: 06: 37,240
I can't find a way to save
my family from the fire that is coming

55
00: 06: 37,320 -> 00: 06: 39,520
We are not ready to die.

56
00: 06: 40,000 -> 00: 06: 43,040
Not ready to die?

57
00: 06: 43,080 -> 00: 06: 48,680
with all the evils of the world, won't it
is it a good thing to run away from it all?

58
00: 06: 48,720 -> 00: 06: 56,400
If I die, my family dies, and this burden
take me to hell.

59
00: 06: 57,280 -> 00: 06: 59,160
Oh, I see

60
00: 06: 59,200 -> 00: 07: 03,400
Oh, I think I can help you

61
00: 07: 03,400 -> 00: 07: 08,000
Who are you talking to?
I don't know

62
00: 07: 08,160 -> 00: 07: 11,360
Stay here, I'll be back

63
00: 07: 15,040 -> 00: 07: 18,560
"Run away from the wrath to come"

64
00: 07: 18,560 -> 00: 07: 21,360
Run?
Where to go?

65
00: 07: 23,200 -> 00: 07: 28,320
There. do you see the gate?

66
00: 07: 28,320 -> 00: 07: 31,080
If you see the hill,
You will see a shining light.

67
00: 07: 33,640 -> 00: 07: 36,000
I think I see something

68
00: 07: 36,120 -> 00: 07: 38,680
Then run there!
and don't look back!

69
00: 07: 39,320 -> 00: 07: 42,200
When you get there,
you will find the gate

70
00: 07: 42,680 -> 00: 07: 45,560
- So what ?
- Knock !

71
00: 07: 46,040 -> 00: 07: 48,560
You know what is done next.

72
00: 07: 49,720 -> 00: 07: 52,640
Why are you silent? Run! and don't turn back!

73
00: 07: 57,680 -> 00: 08: 00,920
Christian, don't run!

74
00: 08: 02,560 -> 00: 08: 09,000
So Christian ran away with all his strength
to the road to the gate

75
00: 08: 09,040 -> 00: 08: 12,520
Come back!
How is your family?

76
00: 08: 13,120 -> 00: 08: 15,600
Run there, crazy man!

77
00: 08: 16,600 -> 00: 08: 19,360
Ah, fast runner.

78
00: 08: 19,560 -> 00: 08: 22,920
But two of his friends were named
Stubborn and Soft

79
00: 08: 22,920 -> 00: 08: 25,560
intend to bring it back

80
00: 08: 25,600 -> 00: 08: 29,360
They found it
Just before he got to the road.

81
00: 08: 29,440 -> 00: 08: 32,600
Christian! Christian!
stop, stop!

82
00: 08: 33,840 -> 00: 08: 36,920
- I'm too old for this.
- Why did you stop me?

83
00: 08: 37,080 -> 00: 08: 40,720
Because we want to talk reason
healthy with you

84
00: 08: 41,200 -> 00: 08: 45,320
Do you want to take me
back to the city of Destruction?

85
00: 08: 45,320 -> 00: 08: 46,360
Yes.

86
00: 08: 46,400 -> 00: 08: 51,360
imagine! The name of our city will be
make you want to run away with me.

87
00: 08: 51,400 -> 00: 08: 55,800
That doesn't make Christian sense,
it's just a name, just a name

88
00: 08: 56,320 -> 00: 09: 02,040
Hear! I have heard the story. you
do we all want to go with you? we will die

89
00: 09: 02,080 -> 00: 09: 04,040
We will die anyway, right?

90
00: 09: 04,080 -> 00: 09: 07,520
And you will be buried in the lake of fire
and sulfur

91
00: 09: 07,560 -> 00: 09: 11,840
Okay, listen to your heart!
What I'm saying is true.

92
00: 09: 11,880 -> 00: 09: 14,480
Come with me!
Save your family, save yourself!

93
00: 09: 14,520 -> 00: 09: 18,400
You don't know what you say, Christian.
Even if you can go through the swamp in front

94
00: 09: 18,440 -> 00: 09: 23,000
Even though you passed the Swamp of Sorrow,
to that extent, there are creatures that will ...

95
00: 09: 23,040 -> 00: 09: 28,480
He will pull the flesh out of your bones
Now imagine the demon king ...

96
00: 09: 28,520 -> 00: 09: 31,360
Apollion.

97
00: 09: 31,400 -> 00: 09: 34,680
You have everything
people in this world.

98
00: 09: 34,720 -> 00: 09: 39,240
You have a beautiful home, a wife
love you, children who respect you

99
00: 09: 39,280 -> 00: 09: 41,320
we have a luxurious life here

100
00: 09: 41,320 -> 00: 09: 45,040
- very luxurious
- yes.

101
00: 09: 45,080 -> 00: 09: 48,520
No, no, don't wait!
this is just a show, ok?

102
00: 09: 48,840 -> 00: 09: 52,720
Come with me and you
will feel true life, true peace !!

103
00: 09: 52,760 -> 00: 09: 55,840
no one can compare
the wages you will receive

104
00: 09: 55,880 -> 00: 09: 57,600
If you follow this path, be loyal to the end.

105
00: 09: 57,640 -> 00: 10: 00,960
Do you think this is the way to go?

106
00: 10: 01,000 -> 00: 10: 05,920
To an extraordinary inheritance, listen?
More than you can think

107
00: 10: 05,960 -> 00: 10: 10,240
It is eternal, cannot be broken
who cannot disappear

108
00: 10: 10,280 -> 00: 10: 12,680
when you diligently
looking for that path

109
00: 10: 12,720 -> 00: 10: 13,640
It sounds good.

110
00: 10: 13,680 -> 00: 10: 15,720
Come on, it's written in this book.

111
00: 10: 15,760 -> 00: 10: 19,840
- Come on!
- I'm not interested in that book, Christian.

112
00: 10: 19,880 -> 00: 10: 24,720
And I want you to go back home.
That's what I want.

113
00: 10: 24,760 -> 00: 10: 26,080
I will not be back.

114
00: 10: 26,120 -> 00: 10: 32,760
How could you not come back?
Will you not come back?

115
00: 10: 32,800 -> 00: 10: 37,160
Not.

116
00: 10: 37,200 -> 00: 10: 42,080
Okay, walk your way!
Let's go, soft!

117
00: 10: 42,200 -> 00: 10: 44,640
Come on he is crazy
and lost common sense.

118
00: 10: 44,680 -> 00: 10: 46,160
no, no, wait!
wait! Wait !

119
00: 10: 46,200 -> 00: 10: 49,360
What if he is right?
If he might be right ...

120
00: 10: 49,400 -> 00: 10: 51,080
Patient !
Listen!

121
00: 10: 51,120 -> 00: 10: 52,840
I've heard someone's story

122
00: 10: 52,880 -> 00: 10: 55,800
and if he is right, it means
he is smarter than us

123
00: 10: 55,840 -> 00: 10: 59,960
He tried to find a place far more
beautiful than we imagined, right?

124
00:11: 00,000 -> 00: 11: 01,560
Yes.

125
00: 11: 01,600 -> 00: 11: 03,720
You lose your mind, Gentle.

126
00: 11: 03,760 -> 00: 11: 06,240
You lose your mind.
You are too close to him

127
00: 11: 06,280 -> 00: 11: 10,120
Listen, things you can do
now is to go home to you

128
00: 11: 10,360 -> 00: 11: 12,560
Return to your wife
and your family!

129
00: 11: 12,600 -> 00: 11: 20,040
He is crazy and if you leave
with him, you will die.

130
00: 11: 20,080 -> 00: 11: 24,360
No, that's not true.
That is not true.

131
00: 11: 24,400 -> 00: 11: 31,400
Follow me, OK? And you will get
what I told you and More than that.

132
00: 11: 31,440 -> 00: 11: 36,680
Therefore it is written in this Book
that He loves us.

133
00: 11: 36,720 -> 00: 11: 39,760
I have decided.
/OK.

134
00: 11: 39,800 -> 00: 11: 41,880
I go with Christianity.

135
00: 11: 41,920 -> 00: 11: 45,320
You know the way to that place right?
/ Yes I know

136
00: 11: 45,320 -> 00: 11: 48,360
The person named Penginjil said follow this path
until the end,

137
00: 11: 48,400 -> 00: 11: 50,600
Will take us to the gate

138
00: 11: 50,640 -> 00: 11: 55,320
come on! okay come on!

139
00: 11: 55,360 -> 00: 11: 59,880
I'm going home
You two are crazy.

140
00: 11: 59,920 -> 00: 12: 03,480
I will enjoy home with
good air conditioner

141
00: 12: 03,520 -> 00: 12: 06,320
Enjoy good food together
my family

142
00: 12: 07,080 -> 00: 12: 09,400
But now you will
playing out there in the swamp.

143
00: 12: 09,440 -> 00: 12: 13,440
We will eat salsa,
I really like that, made by my wife.

144
00: 12: 13,480 -> 00: 12: 16,040
With good fries.
Good beer maybe ...

145
00: 12: 16,080 -> 00: 12: 17,520
Yes, lots of delicious drinks

146
00: 12: 17,520 -> 00: 12: 21,320
You have a lot of beautiful time in the swamp
because I will be very comfortable!

147
00: 12: 21,320 -> 00: 12: 25,200
and now, drink one item
two flies, it's more like your style.

148
00: 12: 25,240 -> 00: 12: 28,880
Have fun friends,
swamps, garbage and mud!

149
00: 12: 28,920 -> 00: 12: 30,320
See you later!

150
00: 12: 30,320 -> 00: 12: 34,040
Are you ready for this trip, friend?

151
00: 12: 34,080 -> 00: 12: 35,760
Yes, yes! Come on, let's go

152
00: 12: 41,120 -> 00: 12: 44,120
- This is amazing
- Can you tell me

153
00: 12: 44,160 -> 00: 12: 46,000
about the Kingdom we are headed for
now?

154
00: 12: 46,040 -> 00: 12: 49,160
It's a little hard to explain actually

155
00: 12: 49,200 -> 00: 12: 50,720
What about the book?

156
00: 12: 50,720 -> 00: 12: 52,720
You believe what is
written there really right?

157
00: 12: 52,720 -> 00: 12: 55,280
-Of course
-Like what?

158
00: 12: 55,320 -> 00: 12: 59,520
Like we will be able to live eternally
in the pure Kingdom of Peace.

159
00: 12: 59,520 -> 00: 13: 03,920
We will be given the crown of glory,
Cloak that shines like the sun

160
00: 13: 04,040 -> 00: 13: 08,520
and there will be no more tears & the Lord
will wipe away everyone's tears

161
00: 13: 08,560 -> 00:13: 10,480
- Is there someone else there?

162
00: 13: 10,480 -> 00: 13: 12,520
- Angels and thousands of eyes
will look

163
00: 13: 12,720 -> 00: 13: 20,040
thousands of thousands, who are already there
before in love and joy

164
00: 13: 20,080 -> 00: 13: 24,760
Sounds good to be true.
If we are there, how do we enter?

165
00: 13: 24,800 -> 00: 13: 27,440
Alright, this book says if we
really miss to get it,

166
00: 13: 27,480 -> 00: 13: 33,920
- ... it will be given free
- You know, I can't wait to get there

167
00: 13: 33,920 -> 00: 13: 37,600
Can you be faster?
- I'm trying my best ...

168
00: 13: 37,640 -> 00: 13: 40,200
"I saw Christian and walked softly
continue..."

169
00: 13: 40,320 -> 00: 13: 48,000
tells the story of the wonders of the Eternal City,
without paying too much attention to the road

170
00: 13: 48,040 -> 00: 13: 50,120
Come on, hurry up a little, we can arrive
get there faster right?

171
00: 13: 50,120 -> 00: 13: 53,600
- OK
- Come on, come on !

172
00: 14: 02,840 -> 00: 14: 06,440
-I got stuck.
-What happened?

173
00: 14: 06,480 -> 00: 14: 08,640
We are in a hurry.
and get off track.

174
00: 14: 08,680 -> 00: 14: 13,320
out of the way we started?
I only follow you.

175
00: 14: 13,320 -> 00: 14: 17,920
Bau here, why me
listen to you

176
00: 14: 17,960 -> 00: 14: 23,120
I will get out of here,
you yourself

177
00: 14: 23,160 -> 00: 14: 28,640
I got stuck!
Soft, I got stuck.

178
00: 14: 28,680 -> 00: 14: 30,320
- Soft, I'm stuck, can I help?
- I'm sorry

179
00: 14: 30,320 -> 00: 14: 38,120
- Soft, will you help me?
- Not

180
00: 14: 38,120 -> 00: 14: 44,600
- soft!
- Have fun

181
00: 14: 53,720 -> 00: 14: 57,680
please!

182
00: 15: 00,200 -> 00: 15: 03,840
With hope that seems to disappear,
people named Pertolongan

183
00: 15: 03,880 -> 00: 15: 07,480
Find Christianity in the swamp

184
00: 15: 07,520 -> 00:15: 11,800
Hello, why are you stuck there?

185
00: 15: 11,840 -> 00: 15: 14,560
Don't know, maybe I'm careless

186
00: 15: 14,600 -> 00: 15: 16,560
Oh, you don't see the road huh?

187
00: 15: 16,600 -> 00: 15: 21,560
- Can you help me out?
- I will throw this rope at you.

188
00: 15: 32,640 -> 00: 15: 37,920
Alamak
You are okay ?

189
00: 15: 37,920 -> 00: 15: 40,920
- Thank you.
- You are welcome !

190
00: 15: 40,960 -> 00: 15: 45,240
Look, there is the road you are looking for!

191
00: 15: 45,280 -> 00: 15: 47,480
Why not be marked with
clear or well cared for?

192
00: 15: 47,520 -> 00: 15: 51,800
Sin! The pipe is full of him

193
00: 15: 51,840 -> 00: 15: 55,520
When the Spirit of GOD starts
awaken from a state of sin ...

194
00: 15: 55,560 -> 00: 16: 01,600
they all became scared
along with many thoughts blocking.

195
00: 16: 01,640 -> 00: 16: 04,560
And it ends like there

196
00: 16: 04,600 -> 00: 16: 07,720
But the King, the King is preparing
way out

197
00: 16: 07,760 -> 00: 16: 12,800
You stay on track,
You will be fine

198
00: 16: 12,840 -> 00: 16: 17,000
- Hey, thank you for all.
-No problem, bro.

199
00: 16: 17,040 -> 00: 16: 20,240
For that I am here

200
00: 16: 21,720 -> 00: 16: 26,320
"In my dream, I saw Christianity
continue the journey on the track ... "

201
00: 16: 26,320 -> 00: 16: 29,120
He will meet with
someone with gold tongues

202
00: 16: 29,120 -> 00: 16: 35,080
By the name of Mr. World Policy
from the City of Lust

203
00: 16: 35,120 -> 00: 16: 39,120
Hello good people!
How heavy is your burden behind!

204
00: 16: 39,160 -> 00: 16: 41,760
-Yes, it's troublesome.
-Where are you going ?

205
00: 16: 41,800 -> 00: 16: 44,760
Someone named Penginjil said
I followed this path to the gate

206
00: 16: 44,800 -> 00: 16: 48,000
and I will be able to let go
this burden

207
00: 16: 48,040 -> 00: 16: 51,000
The Evangelist tells you
to follow this path?

208
00: 16: 53,080 -> 00: 16: 57,320
I already know. He does not understand
what he said

209
00: 16: 57,360 -> 00: 17: 00,960
You can meet the path
more dangerous if you want.

210
00: 17: 01,000 -> 00: 17: 06,840
it looks from your face, apparently
You made it through the Swamp of Sorrow

211
00: 17: 06,880 -> 00: 17: 09,200
That's the easy part

212
00: 17: 09,240 -> 00: 17: 14,120
Stick to this path and you will
find fatigue, suffering

213
00: 17: 14,120 -> 00: 17: 19,440
starvation, thief, what is called
wrath of Apollion.

214
00: 17: 19,480 -> 00: 17: 27,400
simply, death. Believe me
I heard a lot of stories right away!

215
00: 17: 27,440 -> 00: 17: 31,120
Alright, I'd better face
all the dangers ...

216
00: 17: 31,120 -> 00: 17: 33,120
rather than carrying this burden in life.

217
00: 17: 33,160 -> 00: 17: 36,720
- By the way, how did you get that?
- Reading this

218
00: 17: 36,760 -> 00: 17: 39,760
Ah-ha, I know that.

219
00: 17: 39,800 -> 00: 17: 44,720
it happens to the mind and
weak people, but don't worry

220
00: 17: 44,720 -> 00: 17: 46,120
I have a solution

221
00: 17: 46,160 -> 00: 17: 49,800
in fact, in addition to facing
danger, there is an easy way:

222
00: 17: 49,880 -> 00: 17: 53,440
friendship and pleasure

223
00: 17: 53,480 -> 00: 17: 57,040
OK, I'm listening

224
00: 17: 57,080 -> 00: 18: 07,720
There is a city called Good Action.
it's on a hill, not a mile from here.

225
00: 18: 07,760 -> 00: 18: 12,200
When you get there, look for it
Mr. Obey the Law

226
00: 18: 12,240 -> 00: 18: 16,040
He is an expert at releasing people
kind of yourself

227
00: 18: 16,080 -> 00: 18: 20,920
And if he's not in place
his handsome son, courtesy

228
00: 18: 20,960 -> 00: 18: 24,520
equally experienced in
these things

229
00: 18: 24,520 -> 00: 18: 28,120
You follow the path of goodness!

230
00: 18: 28,120 -> 00: 18: 35,680
You will see

231
00: 18: 39,480 -> 00: 18: 43,160
"If Christian thinks of his burden
heavy, he will search

232
00: 18: 43,200 -> 00: 18: 50,160
things are far worse because of him
will face the Volcano

233
00: 18: 50,200 -> 00: 18: 57,920
Mount Sinai, a dangerous incline
many ended the wandering trip

234
00: 19: 32,920 -> 00: 19: 36,400
What are you doing here ?

235
00: 19: 36,440 -> 00: 19: 39,680
I see that it doesn't take time
long for you to get off track

236
00: 19: 39,720 -> 00: 19: 43,360
I met someone who said
there is an easier way

237
00: 19: 43,400 -> 00: 19: 45,440
and a fast way to
throw away my burden

238
00: 19: 45,480 -> 00: 19: 51,920
God says that the righteous
will live by faith

239
00: 19: 52,000 -> 00: 19: 57,080
and if he turns away, I don't
will be pleased with him. "

240
00: 19: 57,120 -> 00: 19: 59,640
I should not doubt
What are you saying.

241
00: 19: 59,680 -> 00: 20: 02,960
now you feel miserable
because you came out of the way of the LORD

242
00: 20: 03,000 -> 00: 20: 05,360
and get out of the Way of Peace

243
00: 20: 05,400 -> 00: 20: 07,320
Alreadyend up?

244
00: 20: 07,360 -> 00:20: 13,320
I never found a way
to save my family

245
00: 20: 14,320 -> 00:20: 18,720
Be careful, my child!
Every sin will be forgiven

246
00: 20: 18,760 -> 00: 20: 22,360
Believe and believe it!

247
00: 20: 22,400 -> 00: 20: 25,200
there are 3 things said
host of World Policy

248
00: 20: 25,240 -> 00: 20: 27,960
which he called wisdom
which you must hate

249
00: 20: 28,000 -> 00: 20: 30,360
He guides you out
from the right path

250
00: 20: 30,400 -> 00: 20: 34,040
<i> Enter through that narrow door </ i>
because the door is narrow

251
00: 20: 34,080 -> 00: 20: 37,280
<i> that leads to life </ i>
and a little goes through it. "

252
00: 20: 37,320 -> 00: 20: 41,920
Mr. World Policy wants you
against what Christ did on the cross.

253
00: 20: 41,920 -> 00: 20: 47,600
The King of Glory himself said
<i> "Whoever saves his life </ i>

254
00: 20: 47,640 -> 00: 20: 51,040
<i> will lose his life, but he </ i>
who accepts Him, will be saved "

255
00: 20: 51,080 -> 00: 20: 55,000
Mr. World Policy wants you
bound by law

256
00: 20: 55,040 -> 00: 21: 00,960
so that you are dying in your sins
and not submit to Him.

257
00: 21: 01,000 -> 00: 21: 02,440
So what should be done?

258
00: 21: 02,480 -> 00: 21: 06,840
Get back on track!
And if you miss this time,

259
00: 21: 06,880 -> 00: 21: 09,920
There is no guarantee that assistance will come

260
00: 21: 09,960 -> 00: 21: 13,920
thank you

261
00: 21: 20,280 -> 00: 21: 23,160
"Christian managed to get back on track"

262
00: 21: 23,200 -> 00: 21: 27,320
Little did he know that the gate
the Evangelist said

263
00: 21: 27,360 -> 00: 21: 33,600
just a step ahead
so is the fortress of Satan

264
00: 21: 59,320 -> 00: 22: 04,720
- Let me in!
- What do you want ?

265
00: 22: 04,760 -> 00: 22: 09,800
I was told I could find
way out through this door.

266
00: 22: 16,920 -> 00: 22: 19,920
- It's almost out there
- What happened outside?

267
00: 22: 19,920 -> 00: 22: 22,880
oh, there's an enemy fort near here,

268
00: 22: 22,920 -> 00: 22: 28,320
and Satan fired an arrow at
anyone who enters through this gate

269
00: 22: 28,360 -> 00: 22: 30,600
Ah, he killed some out there.

270
00: 22: 30,640 -> 00: 22: 32,360
Praise the Lord, let me enter.

271
00: 22: 32,400 -> 00: 22: 35,240
Oh of course,
He is worthy of praise.

272
00: 22: 35,280 -> 00: 22: 40,920
We never refuse anyone,
no matter their sins in the past

273
00: 22: 40,960 -> 00: 22: 44,320
Who told you the way here?

274
00: 22: 44,320 -> 00: 22: 47,440
Someone named Penginjil said
and show the way

275
00: 22: 47,480 -> 00: 22: 58,040
That might be me.

276
00: 22: 58,080 -> 00: 23: 00,520
This is the way, this is the way to go
you go through

277
00: 23: 00,520 -> 00: 23: 06,720
This path is made by our ancestors,
prophets, Jesus and His disciples

278
00: 23: 06,720 -> 00: 23: 12,520
to heaven, to
heavenly city.

279
00: 23: 12,520 -> 00: 23: 15,160
What is impossible for
lost on the trip?

280
00: 23: 15,200 -> 00: 23: 20,680
Many paths get out of the way
because of many trials!

281
00: 23: 20,720 -> 00: 23: 23,480
but you know to distinguish the path
the right from the wrong

282
00: 23: 23,520 -> 00: 23: 27,920
Because you will remain
on narrow lanes

283
00: 23: 27,960 -> 00: 23: 29,560
Can you help me
let go of this terrible burden from me?

284
00: 23: 30,560 -> 00: 23: 34,920
Oh, I'm afraid you should
carry the load a little longer

285
00: 23: 34,920 -> 00: 23: 41,240
When you arrive at the Safety Place
the burden will fall on its own

286
00: 23: 41,280 -> 00: 23: 43,120
Be faithful!

287
00: 23: 43,120 -> 00: 23: 46,240
You walk straight this path
and you will arrive

288
00: 23: 46,280 -> 00: 23: 49,920
at the Translator's house!
Tap and he will answer!

289
00: 23: 49,960 -> 00: 23: 59,880
And he will tell you things
big thing that you don't know yet

290
00: 23: 59,920 -> 00: 24: 03,840
thanks.

291
00: 24: 03,880 -> 00: 24: 08,440
"And I see when Christian and
Kindness is friends ... "

292
00: 24: 08,480 -> 00: 24: 17,640
"Christians walk for some time,
before reaching the Translator's house. "

293
00: 24: 18,680 -> 00: 24: 22,040
Welcome, I see you
made it to the gate

294
00: 24: 22,080 -> 00: 24: 24,920
I believe in the goodness
show you the way

295
00: 24: 24,960 -> 00: 24: 28,520
He said you would tell
big things I don't know yet.

296
00: 24: 28,560 -> 00: 24: 31,800
Of course, a lot is necessary
shown to you.

297
00: 24: 31,840 -> 00: 24: 36,120
- Only hope
- thank you.

298
00: 24: 51,240 -> 00: 24: 54,200
Please clean the room!

299
00: 25: 05,720 -> 00: 25: 13,440
wet the room with water, so
the dust can be cleaned!

300
00: 25: 13,480 -> 00:25: 16,760
I don't understand the point

301
00: 25: 16,800 -> 00: 25: 21,280
this waiter shows his heart
who never

30200: 25: 21,320 -> 00: 25: 24,600
cleansed by the Grace of the gospel

303
00: 25: 24,640 -> 00: 25: 30,880
this dust is the original sin
continue to disturb and damage

304
00: 25: 30,920 -> 00: 25: 34,720
man symbolizes law,
instead he cleanses the heart,

305
00: 25: 34,720 -> 00: 25: 40,120
but only give
sin of strength

306
00: 25: 40,160 -> 00: 25: 43,560
Women are spreading
water symbolizes the gospel

307
00: 25: 43,600 -> 00: 25: 47,560
who can conquer
sin in our lives

308
00: 25: 47,600 -> 00: 25: 51,760
When the heart is clean, then
according to the King of Glory

309
00: 25: 51,800 -> 00: 25: 56,040
to enter and stay.

310
00: 26: 26,080 -> 00: 26: 28,600
The palace symbolizes Heaven

311
00: 26: 28,720 -> 00: 26: 36,800
There are some who have courage
to face challenges

312
00: 26: 36,840 -> 00: 26: 40,880
Write my name "Undaunted".

313
00: 27: 44,040 -> 00: 27: 48,320
"And I heard a voice coming out
from inside the palace to that person:

314
00: 27: 48,360 -> 00: 27: 49,920
Come in, come in!

315
00: 27: 49,960 -> 00: 27: 57,280
Enter immortal immortality

316
00: 27: 57,320 -> 00: 27: 59,520
I think I understand the point.

317
00: 27: 59,520 -> 00: 28: 02,000
Nice.

318
00: 28: 28,920 -> 00: 28: 33,920
Why is he so scared?

319
00: 28: 33,920 -> 00: 28: 39,320
Tell this person
why are you scared!

320
00: 28: 39,360 -> 00: 28: 42,960
I got a nightmare.

321
00: 28: 43,000 -> 00: 28: 50,520
No, it's more like vision

322
00: 28: 50,560 -> 00: 28: 56,760
I see dark clouds
rising high into the sky

323
00: 28: 56,800 -> 00: 29: 03,800
And there is lightning and lightning there
seems to shake the world

324
00: 29: 03,840 -> 00: 29: 09,520
I heard the sound of the trumpet
And I saw someone in the cloud

325
00: 29: 09,520 -> 00: 29: 14,320
dress like lightning-lightning

326
00: 29: 14,360 -> 00: 29: 18,520
And thousands of people like you

327
00: 29: 18,520 -> 00: 29: 22,200
And there is a voice
shake said:

328
00: 29: 22,240 -> 00: 29: 29,120
<i> "Arise ye who are dead </ i>
and come to judgment! "

329
00: 29: 29,120 -> 00: 29: 34,560
open graves and
people die out.

330
00: 29: 34,600 -> 00: 29: 44,240
and He opened the book and all
people on earth stand before Him.

331
00: 29: 44,280 -> 00: 29: 48,880
And He said to His army
clean the fields

332
00: 29: 48,920 -> 00: 29: 53,840
collect wheat into the barn
but stumps into the lake of fire

333
00: 29: 53,880 -> 00: 29: 59,760
and he was lifted to the clouds

334
00: 29: 59,800 -> 00: 30: 04,240
I'm left behind.

335
00: 30: 04,280 -> 00: 30: 08,040
I tried to hide from
He is on the cloud.

336
00: 30: 08,080 -> 00: 30: 12,320
But my sins are all flashed on
my eyes, and I know I'm wrong

337
00: 30: 12,360 -> 00: 30: 20,520
and there is nothing I can do
or say to change it ..

338
00: 30: 20,520 -> 00: 30: 24,080
I know judgment day
the time has come.

339
00: 30: 24,120 -> 00: 30: 30,840
I know I'm not ready.
Hell is real

340
00: 30: 30,880 -> 00: 30: 35,360
And that's where I go

341
00: 30: 51,960 -> 00: 30: 57,280
So what do you think about
what have i shown you?

342
00: 30: 57,320 -> 00: 31: 03,160
There is great hope,
and great angst.

343
00: 31: 03,200 -> 00: 31: 07,360
Save these things in your heart
and remember the Helper,

344
00: 31: 07,400 -> 00: 31: 13,000
will always be there for
lead your way to heaven.

345
00: 31: 13,040 -> 00: 31: 18,480
Come on, let me take it
you're back on track!

346
00: 31: 18,520 -> 00: 31: 23,760
"Now, I look inside
Christian dreams are back on track. "

347
00: 31: 23,800 -> 00: 31: 27,240
The burden seems increasingly
heavy than before.

348
00: 31: 27,280 -> 00: 31: 30,120
"He hopes to let go
yourself from what's ahead. "

349
00: 31: 30,120 -> 00: 31: 34,000
"but the Christian faith makes
he goes on. "

350
00: 31: 34,040 -> 00: 31: 39,800
"He will arrive soon
in a place called Salvation ".

351
00: 33: 13,160 -> 00: 33: 15,720
Thank you !

352
00: 33: 15,800 -> 00: 33: 18,520
Thank you !

353
00: 33: 22,600 -> 00: 33: 24,880
Thank you !

354
00: 33: 50,560 -> 00: 34: 03,920
You give relief with
your life and life with your death

355
00: 34: 09,400 -> 00: 34: 14,920
Peace be with you!
Your sins have been forgiven.

356
00: 34: 20,720 -> 00: 34: 24,880
Save this Word because they will
provide strength in the journey.

357
00: 34: 24,920 -> 00: 34: 28,680
You must show this on
the gate of the Eternal City.

358
00: 34: 28,720 -> 00: 34: 35,560
Take care of it with your life.
This is for you.

359
00: 34: 36,280 -> 00: 34: 39,840
"Now, I see Christianity
continue his journey.

360
00: 34: 39,880 -> 00: 34: 43,120
with new passion and purpose.

361
00: 34: 43,160 -> 00: 34: 47,720
with a certificate in his hand,
he is sure of heaven. "

362
00: 34: 47,760 -> 00: 34: 52,480
Not far from there, two people
is on their way.

363
00: 34: 52,520 -> 00:34: 56,960
He will stumble with it
Liability and Hypocrisy,

364
00: 34: 57,000 -> 00: 35: 04,720
Two people don't know this hard
make his own way to heaven.

365
00: 35: 04,840 -> 00: 35: 05,800
- Man!

366
00: 35: 05,840 -> 00: 35: 07,200
- Hello!

367
00: 35: 07,240 -> 00: 35: 07,880
- Hello!

368
00: 35: 07,920 -> 00: 35: 08,680
How are you ?

369
00: 35: 08,720 -> 00: 35: 10,720
Well.

370
00: 35: 10,760 -> 00: 35: 11,680
Where are you from ?

371
00: 35: 11,720 -> 00: 35: 14,400
We are from the Land of Glory in vain.

372
00: 35: 14,440 -> 00: 35: 15,280
Ha? Where are you going?

373
00: 35: 15,320 -> 00: 35: 19,120
We head to Eternal City
to get praise.

374
00: 35: 19,120 -> 00: 35: 21,960
Why don't you enter?
through the gate?

375
00: 35: 22,000 -> 00: 35: 24,720
I mean, isn't it written by people
that doesn't enter through the door ...

376
00: 35: 24,760 -> 00: 35: 27,160
will be called thieves and robbers?

377
00: 35: 27,200 -> 00: 35: 31,400
That's you, but we don't.

378
00: 35: 31,440 -> 00: 35: 35,520
and if you know how far away
The gate is wherever you live

379
00: 35: 35,560 -> 00: 35: 38,040
You will also take a shortcut.

380
00: 35: 38,080 -> 00: 35: 41,160
Is that not contradictory
with the City Lord?

381
00: 35: 42,160 -> 00: 35: 43,840
You worry too much.

382
00: 35: 43,880 -> 00: 35: 47,120
Our people have taken it
these shortcuts take centuries

383
00: 35: 47,160 -> 00: 35: 51,400
And that is our way because.
all can remember it

384
00: 35: 51,440 -> 00: 35: 58,280
We are sure that the Judge is Just
in that city will let us in.

385
00: 35: 58,320 -> 00: 36: 01,840
After all, we are both inside
same path

386
00: 36: 01,880 -> 00: 36: 04,480
Are you bothered with
us?

387
00: 36: 04,520 -> 00: 36: 05,920
That's not what I mean

388
00: 36: 05,960 -> 00: 36: 08,960
You can't walk
make your own rules.

389
00: 36: 09,000 -> 00: 36: 16,520
I mean, according to what is written, the King
will not let you enter the Eternal City

390
00: 36: 16,520 -> 00: 36: 19,040
O, I think that's a good idea ...

391
00: 36: 19,080 -> 00: 36: 22,000
Why not go first and
wear your mind?

392
00: 36: 22,040 -> 00: 36: 27,240
We will wait and see
what will come out at the end.

393
00: 36: 27,280 -> 00: 36: 30,320
Come on!

394
00: 36: 37,480 -> 00: 36: 48,720
"In my dream, I saw a new friend
it runs with fun.

395
00: 36: 48,760 -> 00: 36: 56,160
Does not take long before
they are in front of the Valley of Trouble

396
00: 36: 56,200 -> 00: 37: 02,920
Now Obligations and Hypocrisy will
take a road called Jalan Gampang. "

397
00: 37: 02,960 -> 00: 37: 08,000
So instead of climbing the hill, they are
take a path called Destruction

398
00: 37: 08,000 -> 00: 37: 13,000
And others take
road called danger

399
00: 37: 13,040 -> 00: 37: 18,720
They are confident that they will
find Christians on the other side

400
00: 38: 08,480 -> 00: 38: 12,440
"In my dream I saw
night coming soon "

401
00: 38: 12,440 -> 00: 38: 16,200
"With Christians coming
Beautiful Palace. "

402
00: 38: 16,320 -> 00: 38: 22,080
Christians will find out why
many travelers lost their lives

403
00: 38: 22,120 -> 00: 38: 25,160
when approaching that state
the best..

404
00: 38: 38,960 -> 00: 38: 44,360
Is your faith so small?
There is nothing to fear.

405
00: 38: 44,400 -> 00: 38: 46,920
They are here to test faith.

406
00: 38: 46,920 -> 00: 38: 52,520
If you stay on your path,
you will be fine.

407
00: 39: 28,120 -> 00: 39: 32,240
thanks.

408
00: 39: 32,280 -> 00: 39: 34,800
Do you mind if
did I spend one night?

409
00: 39: 34,840 -> 00: 39: 37,880
This house was built by Mr.
up this hill to provide

410
00: 39: 38,000 -> 00: 39: 40,960
relief for inner pilgrims
trip to Eternal City.

411
00: 39: 41,000 -> 00: 39: 45,760
But things stay or not,
depends on this hostess.

412
00: 39: 45,800 -> 00: 39: 50,720
"In my dream, I saw Christianity
enjoy an amazing meal. "

413
00: 39: 50,760 -> 00: 39: 56,600
"After the dish, they tell about
The LORD is a defeated hero

414
00: 39: 56,600 -> 00: 40: 02,520
death on the cross, but no one helps
great danger and blood loss. "

415
00: 40: 02,520 -> 00: 40: 06,080
He does this with love
pure for his country

416
00: 40: 06,120 -> 00: 40: 11,680
- Why are you a traveler?

417
00: 40: 11,720 -> 00: 40: 14,920
I'm looking for a way out for my family
and me from the coming fire

418
00: 40: 14,920 -> 00: 40: 18,800
Is that the only reason
you are looking for that Eternal City,

419
00: 40: 18,840 -> 00: 40: 21,960
to escape hell fire?

420
00: 40: 22,000 -> 00: 40: 26,600
I want to see Him who lives
who died because of the sins of the world

421
00: 40: 26,640 -> 00: 40: 31,120
I know I have to make a crime
from me, and want to stay with them ...

422
00: 40: 31,120 -> 00: 40: 36,400
who sings "Holy, Holy, Holy
GOD OF GOD. "

423
00: 40: 36,440 -> 00: 40: 40,280
Where is your family ?

424
00: 40: 50,480 -> 00: 40: 57,880
I have tried to have them with me,
I pray sincerely for that

425
00: 40: 57,920 -> 00: 41: 05,320
I said how the LORD will
destroy our city and judgment.

426
00: 41: 05,360 -> 00: 41: 09,520
They don't listen to me

427
00: 41: 09,520 -> 00: 41: 11,640
So I decided to
make this trip with

428
00: 41: 11,680 -> 00: 41: 15,520
with yourself, looking for
the way for all of us

429
00: 41: 15,560 -> 00: 41: 23,360
Sometimes I think if
I can finish to the end

430
00: 41: 23,400 -> 00: 41: 27,720
The biggest fear is me
leaving them all to suffer

431
00: 41: 27,760 -> 00: 41: 31,440
I believe you do with
all forces convince your family

432
00: 41: 31,480 -> 00: 41: 38,160
to go with you.
You must be tired.

433
00: 41: 38,200 -> 00: 41: 42,120
Come on! We will
show your room

434
00: 41: 42,160 -> 00: 41: 44,080
thanks.

435
00: 41: 44,120 -> 00: 41: 47,920
Thank you to all of you.

436
00: 41: 47,920 -> 00: 41: 51,720
The next few days, Christian was shown
big room that saves

437
00: 41: 51,760 -> 00: 41: 58,240
artifacts and weapons to strengthen them
the faithful on the way to heaven

438
00: 41: 58,280 -> 00: 42: 00,880
It's amazing how God uses people
ordinary people and ordinary objects

439
00: 42: 00,920 -> 00: 42: 03,840
to do great miracles

440
00: 42: 03,880 -> 00: 42: 06,360
And this is one of my favorites

441
00: 42: 06,400 -> 00: 42: 10,320
This is the stick Moses
use guiding the Israelites

442
00: 42: 10,360 -> 00: 42: 16,640
across the Red Sea
to the Promised land

443
00: 42: 19,920 -> 00: 42: 25,000
Bulbs, trumpets, and lights are used
Gideon frightened the Midian Army

444
00: 42: 25,040 -> 00: 42: 29,960
save their lives

445
00: 42: 34,280 -> 00: 42: 40,720
Samson uses this bone for
defeat all the troops themselves

446
00: 42: 40,760 -> 00: 42: 50,160
and these are slabs and stones, which
used David to defeat Goliath at Gath

447
00: 43: 03,480 -> 00: 43: 06,360
Who wears armor and
this sword?

448
00: 43: 06,400 -> 00: 43: 11,920
Nothing, this is for you.

449
00: 43: 11,960 -> 00: 43: 15,760
You need this for
finish your trip.

450
00: 43: 36,760 -> 00: 43: 43,000
"In my dreams, it doesn't take long
for Christians to wear their armor and swords

451
00: 43: 43,040 -> 00: 43: 51,720
As he entered the valley of humiliation
The residence of the mighty devil, Apollion.

452
00: 44: 25,600 -> 00: 44: 30,520
Where are you and
where did you go?

453
00: 44: 30,560 -> 00: 44: 32,920
I come from the City of Destruction.

454
00: 44: 32,920 -> 00: 44: 35,040
And I'm inside
trip to Eternal City.

455
00: 44: 35,080 -> 00: 44: 40,880
I am the prince of that city,
and you are mine

456
00: 44: 40,920 -> 00: 44: 45,680
Your path is too big for everyone,
because the way of sin is death

457
00: 44: 45,720 -> 00: 44: 50,440
I decided to find a way
better, bigger wages.

458
00: 44: 50,480 -> 00: 44: 53,720
I hate losing
one of my subjects

459
00: 44: 53,720 -> 00: 44: 57,440
And since you complained about your reward,
I promise to pay you well

460
00: 44: 57,400 -> 00: 45: 01,560
... as long as you come back
to my country

461
00: 45: 01,600 -> 00: 45: 07,240
I have given myself to the King
all kings, how can you turn around?

462
00: 45: 12,320 -> 00: 45: 18,800
Many have chosen your path
but they returned to me.

463
00: 45: 18,840 -> 00: 45: 23,080
You will certainly be the same.

464
00: 45: 40,360 -> 00: 45: 42,760
I won't turn away
my body to him

465
00: 45: 42,800 -> 00: 45: 45,120
You don't know what you say

466
00: 45: 45,160 -> 00: 45: 50,320
I chose for his duty
His way is more worthy of my path

467
00: 45: 50,360 -> 00: 45: 55,040
Those who follow Him have gone through
various trials and great misery.

468
00: 45: 55,080 -> 00: 45: 57,240
Many die inside
terrible death

469
00: 45: 57,240 -> 00: 46: 00,800
And you there, said
His path is greater than mine?

470
00: 46: 00,800 -> 00: 46: 04,720
Trials and misery is a test
to strengthen our faith

471
00: 46: 04,760 -> 00: 46: 07,920
And those who die will receive
big reward from my prince with

472
00: 46: 07,960 -> 00: 46: 09,360
all His glory and all angels

473
00: 46: 09,400 -> 00: 46: 14,480
Strengthen your faith? You
has not been loyal to him from the beginning.

474
00: 46: 14,520 -> 00: 46: 18,080
How ?
How am I not loyal to Him?

475
00: 46: 18,120 -> 00: 46: 24,160
Don't you remember you almost
Immersed in Swamp of Sorrow?

476
00: 46: 26,520 -> 00: 46: 33,320
And how do you deviate
to release your burden?

477
00: 46: 33,320 -> 00: 46: 39,040
Fear often grips you
and often you think backwards478
00: 46: 39,080 -> 00: 46: 41,400
That's true even
Furthermore

479
00: 46: 41,440 -> 00: 46: 44,760
but the Prince I serve
and worship ready to forgive

480
00: 46: 44,800 -> 00: 46: 50,200
when repenting of my sin, me
it will not turn me away from Him.

481
00: 46: 50,240 -> 00: 46: 55,760
Then I swear to you
the power of hell. I take your soul!

482
00: 46: 55,800 -> 00: 46: 58,000
Prepare to die !!

483
00: 47: 21,920 -> 00: 47: 26,400
My victory !!

484
00: 48: 19,000 -> 00: 48: 24,560
Be brave of the Faithful Warrior,
I am a hope

485
00: 48: 24,600 -> 00: 48: 28,920
The Lord has sent me with
leaves from the tree of life

486
00: 48: 28,960 -> 00: 48: 34,920
that will cure you
and give strength

487
00: 49: 17,560 -> 00: 49: 22,320
"In my dream, I saw Christianity
stronger than before

488
00: 49: 22,360 -> 00: 49: 26,320
after being cured by
leaf of the Tree of Life

489
00: 49: 26,320 -> 00: 49: 31,480
"He needs that strength because of that
he will see the valley of darkness "

490
00: 49: 31,520 -> 00: 49: 36,360
"A more frightening place
even from great Apolion "

491
00: 49: 47,760 -> 00: 49: 50,720
Come back!

492
00: 49: 50,720 -> 00: 49: 51,440
wait!

493
00: 49: 52,480 -> 00: 49: 54,640
if only you were still alive,
come back now!

494
00: 49: 54,680 -> 00: 49: 57,400
What do you see? Say it
me what you see!

495
00: 49: 57,440 -> 00: 49: 59,640
Devils and creatures from the abyss of hell!

496
00: 49: 59,680 -> 00: 50: 01,960
Scarier than the one
you can imagine

497
00: 50: 02,000 -> 00: 50: 04,280
We see shouts and horrors
Turn around while there is a chance

498
00: 50: 04,320 -> 00: 50: 06,120
I can't turn around now

499
00: 50: 06,160 -> 00: 50: 09,640
This is the road
the only one to the Eternal City

500
00: 50: 09,680 -> 00: 50: 12,960
Okay, don't say us
haven't warned you!

501
00: 51: 49,960 -> 00: 51: 52,600
"Even though I walked in
valley of darkness ...

502
00: 51: 52,640 -> 00: 51: 56,320
"I'm not afraid of anything (evil)
for you are with me ...

503
00: 51: 56,400 -> 00: 52: 01,840
"Your mace and your staff comfort me;

504
00: 52: 01,880 -> 00: 52: 07,160
"You provide food for me
in front of my opponent, my wattle are full of abundance "

505
00: 52: 07,200 -> 00: 52: 10,320
"Sheer virtue and mercy
will follow me for the rest of my life "

506
00: 52: 10,320 -> 00: 52: 15,040
"And I will dwell inside
The house of the LORD of all time. "

507
00: 52: 33,520 -> 00: 52: 40,120
Christians distance themselves
as much as possible from the Valley of Death

508
00: 52: 41,120 -> 00: 52: 45,320
He prayed to GOD if GOD
provide companion on the trip

509
00: 52: 45,320 -> 00: 52: 49,480
Prayer seems to be answered, along with Faithful,

510
00: 52: 49,480 -> 00: 52: 53,560
old friend of the City of Destruction,
just a step ahead.

511
00: 52: 53,920 -> 00: 52: 58,840
Hey! Wait and me
will be with you!

512
00: 52: 58,880 -> 00: 53: 01,880
Can't, my life is in danger

513
00: 53: 01,920 -> 00: 53: 06,120
The angel of death is chasing me.

514
00: 53: 22,240 -> 00: 53: 25,360
- Oh, Christian!
- Faithful!

515
00: 53: 28,520 -> 00: 53: 32,720
- Faithful!
- Oh, nice to see you!

516
00: 53: 32,720 -> 00: 53: 35,600
I'm glad to meet you,
I really want to join you

517
00: 53: 35,640 -> 00: 53: 38,000
but when I make a decision,
You are far away.

518
00: 53: 38,040 -> 00: 53: 43,960
- wow, how long have you been waiting before leaving?
- Until I can't stand it anymore

519
00: 53: 44,000 -> 00: 53: 46,600
What you will not believe
that happened when you left

520
00: 53: 46,640 -> 00: 53: 50,520
All talk about fire from
heaven that will finish the city.

521
00: 53: 50,520 -> 00: 53: 56,680
- Extraordinary
- I do not understand. which one else?

522
00: 53: 56,720 -> 00: 53: 59,560
they tell each other
believe that that might happen

523
00: 53: 59,600 -> 00: 54: 03,080
In fact, they are even
criticize you first go

524
00: 54: 03,520 -> 00: 54: 06,160
I have to go from there
Before it's all too late.

525
00: 54: 06,200 -> 00: 54: 09,000
I know in my heart that is true

526
00: 54: 09,040 -> 00: 54: 15,760
- Alright, you are here!
- Hey, we are in an open area

527
00: 54: 15,800 -> 00: 54: 19,720
let's leave here!

528
00: 54: 23,120 -> 00: 54: 25,760
You know what happened
on Soft?

529
00: 54: 25,800 -> 00: 54: 29,920
hah bad, he left
with you but come back

530
00: 54: 29,920 -> 00: 54: 32,720
-He was ridiculed wherever he went
- I was hoping for him, not sure

531
00: 54: 33,560 -> 00: 54: 43,760
I think he determines his destiny. Why
you did not tell me your trip?

532
00: 54: 43,800 -> 00: 54: 49,800
After successfully passing the Swamp of Sorrow,
nothing much happened to me,

533
00: 54: 49,840 -> 00: 54: 56,800
until I reach the City Gate
and I met the Teaser

534
00: 54: 56,840 -> 00: 55: 00,800
He is really beautiful, and beautiful
and he knows what to say

535
00: 55: 00,840 -> 00: 55: 04,040
Oh God, you bemanaged to run away from it

536
00: 55: 04,080 -> 00: 55: 07,640
I'm not sure I can!

537
00: 55: 07,680 -> 00: 55: 13,200
I'm not sure I did it. I
withhold the trial by remembering Proverbs

538
00: 55: 13,240 -> 00: 55: 20,280
"His leg is going to death, step
headed to hell. "

539
00: 55: 20,320 -> 00: 55: 24,040
I have to go from there.
And to be honest

540
00: 55: 24,080 -> 00: 55: 33,000
There are times when I see
myself think, want it

541
00: 55: 33,040 -> 00: 55: 36,000
God knows I hope
I never met him

542
00: 55: 37,040 -> 00: 55: 39,720
Did you meet other people in the valley?

543
00: 55: 39,720 -> 00: 55: 42,720
I met someone named
Adam First of the City of Deception

544
00: 55: 42,760 -> 00: 55: 46,000
I asked him what you are
do for life and answer:

545
00: 55: 46,040 -> 00: 55: 49,800
"Enjoy all the indulgence of the world."

546
00: 55: 49,840 -> 00: 55: 53,440
He said if I joined him,
I will inherit the greatest inheritance

547
00: 55: 53,480 -> 00: 55: 58,400
and all privileges that can
you imagine it will be mine

548
00: 55: 59,440 -> 00: 56: 02,000
That's not the biggest part.

549
00: 56: 02,120 -> 00: 56: 06,920
He even offered me
three children to marry

550
00: 56: 06,920 -> 00: 56: 14,200
The flesh, the pleasure of the eyes
and Pride of Life

551
00: 56: 14,240 -> 00: 56: 18,600
I almost took the offer.
And it's good to be real

552
00: 56: 18,640 -> 00: 56: 22,480
And when we talk,
extraordinary things happen

553
00: 56: 22,520 -> 00: 56: 27,520
I saw written on his forehead:
<i> "Take off the old man & his behavior." </ i>

554
00: 56: 27,520 -> 00: 56: 32,240
my eyes are open
No matter what he says

555
00: 56: 32,240 -> 00: 56: 34,800
No matter how to persuade me

556
00: 56: 34,800 -> 00: 56: 38,760
I know the purpose, is
get me to his house

557
00: 56: 38,760 -> 00: 56: 42,560
so he can sell me
to live in slavery

558
00: 56: 42,800 -> 00: 56: 43,920
I have to run from it

559
00: 56: 43,920 -> 00: 56: 48,520
but when I tried, he
hold on to me and hold me back

560
00: 56: 48,520 -> 00: 56: 54,240
I think he will tear
meat from my arm.

561
00: 57: 01,120 -> 00: 57: 04,080
Let's sit down!

562
00: 57: 09,240 -> 00: 57: 11,040
do you know who he is?

563
00: 57: 11,080 -> 00: 57: 16,040
- Peace, my best friend!
- Evangelist, is that you ?!

564
00: 57: 16,080 -> 00: 57: 20,880
- Glad to see you,
- we have met before

565
00: 57: 20,880 -> 00: 57: 25,440
I am happy to know you
win over temptation and temptation

566
00: 57: 25,480 -> 00: 57: 27,080
On your way and remember

567
00: 57: 29,120 -> 00: 57: 33,920
there is a crown of life
waiting in your life

568
00: 57: 33,920 -> 00: 57: 37,960
So run away so you can
get it, don't give up

569
00: 57: 37,960 -> 00: 57: 39,720
No matter what
you face!

570
00: 57: 39,760 -> 00: 57: 43,320
And don't let anyone
take your crown!

571
00: 57: 43,360 -> 00: 57: 46,000
You are still in
the target of the devil

572
00: 57: 46,040 -> 00: 57: 50,080
Now, more than that keep your heart
of all

573
00: 57: 50,120 -> 00: 57: 53,920
the desire of the world, because of the heart
selfish ones are really bad

574
00: 57: 53,960 -> 00: 58: 01,960
Remember, you have power on earth
and in heaven to you.

575
00: 58: 02,000 -> 00: 58: 08,800
Now we know you are a prophet
and can see the future.

576
00: 58: 08,840 -> 00: 58: 12,360
Can you say what
will be faced?

577
00: 58: 12,400 -> 00: 58: 15,520
The gospel says we will
experience

578
00: 58: 15,560 -> 00: 58: 18,600
many trials before us
enter the Kingdom of Heaven

579
00: 58: 18,640 -> 00: 58: 23,240
every day brings its own hardships,
As you all know

580
00: 58: 23,280 -> 00: 58: 27,160
But now you will
leave this wilderness

581
00: 58: 27,200 -> 00: 58: 31,880
and go to the city where there is
many enemies

582
00: 58: 31,920 -> 00: 58: 38,920
They will try their best
to kill you

583
00: 58: 38,960 -> 00: 58: 45,920
One ... you two. Will be killed

584
00: 58: 45,960 -> 00: 58: 50,120
because of the testimony of Jesus Christ

585
00: 58: 50,160 -> 00: 58: 56,400
But be faithful to death and
The king will give you a crown

586
00: 58: 56,440 -> 00: 59: 00,840
Now, I will ...
even though it will hurt

587
00: 59: 00,880 -> 00: 59: 04,160
you will escape misery
on the journey you faced

588
00: 59: 04,160 -> 00: 59: 09,880
Stay on track!
God is faithful to the end.

589
00: 59: 09,920 -> 00: 59: 12,520
Christianity and Faithful follow the path
out of the wilderness

590
00: 59: 12,520 -> 00: 59: 16,480
to that city named
city ??of futility

591
00: 59: 16,520 -> 00: 59: 20,080
So named because of all
sold there

592
00: 59: 20,120 -> 00: 59: 23,720
or who is there,
nothing more than futility.

593
00: 59: 23,720 -> 00: 59: 26,920
The city was filled with great sin.

594
00: 59: 26,960 ->00: 59: 33,960
Whatever you want to sell; enjoyment,
lust and pleasure in all forms

595
00: 59: 34,000 -> 00: 59: 36,840
Traders offer to buy
their belongings

596
00: 59: 36,880 -> 00: 59: 39,960
but Christian and Faithful don't buy
any.

597
00: 59: 40,000 -> 00: 59: 43,720
Instead, they tried to preach
good news from the gospel

598
00: 59: 43,760 -> 00: 59: 47,520
but the city became angry
and people gathered around them

599
00: 59: 47,520 -> 00: 59: 52,520
Disarming the armor and sword of Christianity,

600
00: 59: 52,560 -> 00: 59: 57,360
They are chained so they can
brought to the judge

601
01: 00: 15,480 -> 01: 00: 18,560
What's your business here?

602
01: 00: 18,600 -> 01: 00: 24,120
We are deep travelers
return trip to our city, Eternal City

603
01: 00: 28,720 -> 01: 00: 31,680
They don't buy anything
from U.S!

604
01: 00: 31,680 -> 01: 00: 37,320
I have heard.
So what do you want to buy?

605
01: 00: 37,360 -> 01: 00: 40,400
Truth

606
01: 00: 42,120 -> 01: 00: 48,000
and what is the truth?

607
01: 00: 48,125 -> 01: 00: 53,400
People's vanity, I know you guys
religious people

608
01: 00: 53,440 -> 01: 00: 58,720
You seek and worship a lot
God. god of money, god of sex,

609
01: 00: 58,760 -> 01: 01: 05,680
god of education, god of knowledge.

610
01: 01: 05,720 -> 01: 01: 09,640
But I'm here to tell
GOD of heaven and earth

611
01: 01: 09,760 -> 01: 01: 14,720
The LORD all things, the Creator of all things,
The Lord of truth

612
01: 01: 14,720 -> 01: 01: 18,240
It is written
"The truth will set you free."

613
01: 01: 18,280 -> 01: 01: 24,040
Jesus said
<i> "I am the truth, </ i>

614
01: 01: 24,080 -> 01: 01: 27,000
<i> and live. there is no one </ i>
come to the Father, except through Me. "

615
01: 01: 27,040 -> 01: 01: 31,520
the god you worship will only
lead you to hell

616
01: 01: 31,520 -> 01: 01: 36,160
Admit your sins and serve the Lord
we are Jesus Christ

617
01: 01: 36,200 -> 01: 01: 39,800
and instead, you will
given eternal life.

618
01: 01: 39,840 -> 01: 01: 43,920
Liar! They don't say
the truth!

619
01: 01: 43,920 -> 01: 01: 48,120
Quiet! Calm down in court!

620
01: 01: 48,160 -> 01: 01: 55,240
You are sued for accusation
disturb the peace of this city

621
01: 01: 55,240 -> 01: 02: 01,000
trigger riots and spread
your poisonous news to this city person

622
01: 02: 01,000 -> 01: 02: 06,320
which is clearly prohibited by

623
01: 02: 06,320 -> 01: 02: 12,160
the law of Beelzebul, our prince
What is your defense?

624
01: 02: 12,200 -> 01: 02: 17,640
- I am a peaceful person.
- Lie !

625
01: 02: 19,680 -> 01: 02: 25,720
There are in this city that, have taken
the message of the gospel about the heart,

626
01: 02: 25,720 -> 01: 02: 28,520
they are on their way to
a better life

627
01: 02: 28,560 -> 01: 02: 32,720
- They made fun of us again!
- calm down!

628
01: 02: 32,760 -> 01: 02: 39,920
happened so in court!
and you say you're a peaceful person?

629
01: 02: 39,920 -> 01: 02: 46,560
- Call the first witness!
- Assembly calls Envy Heart.

630
01: 02: 51,120 -> 01: 02: 57,640
- Know them?
- Yes, they are evil like when they come.

631
01: 02: 57,680 -> 01: 03: 00,680
They don't respect our principles
our people.

632
01: 03: 00,720 -> 01: 03: 04,040
They try to erode it
our society with

633
01: 03: 04,080 -> 01: 03: 07,840
The principle of faith and holiness.

634
01: 03: 07,880 -> 01: 03: 13,040
They say Christianity
and our city principle

635
01: 03: 13,080 -> 01: 03: 17,600
180 degrees in conflict
and cannot blend

636
01: 03: 17,640 -> 01: 03: 20,320
And they don't just blame
that but also us

637
01: 03: 20,320 -> 01: 03: 26,320
because of doing it
- You may go down.

638
01: 03: 26,320 -> 01: 03: 31,320
- The council calls forward superstition
- Ooooh, superstition

639
01: 03: 31,320 -> 01: 03: 35,280
It seems interesting

640
01: 03: 37,800 -> 01: 03: 40,720
- Know them?
- Not.

641
01: 03: 40,840 -> 01: 03: 46,960
No, I don't know
I don't want to know them

642
01: 03: 47,000 -> 01: 03: 52,240
But I heard them say
our religion is meaningless, because

643
01: 03: 52,280 -> 01: 03: 58,520
We are still alive in our sins
and we die.

644
01: 03: 58,520 -> 01: 04: 01,880
- That is all
- You may go down

645
01: 04: 01,920 -> 01: 04: 06,640
- Call the next witness!
- People call Lickers.

646
01: 04: 10,680 -> 01: 04: 19,720
- Know them?
- Ah, yes.

647
01: 04: 19,720 -> 01: 04: 25,520
I know this person for a long time

648
01: 04: 25,520 -> 01: 04: 30,640
And he said something
that can't be said!

649
01: 04: 30,680 -> 01: 04: 37,600
He has opposed the great prince
Beelzebul, and these honorable people

650
01: 04: 37,640 -> 01: 04: 49,520
He also said if he went the way,
they will all escape the city

651
01: 04: 49,560 -> 01: 04: 54,440
But they say
good things for you,

652
01: 04: 54,480 -> 01: 05: 02,400
yesterday, with confidence, he said
You are a godless criminal

653
1:05: 02,440 -> 01: 05: 07,400
and wrong for
become a judge

654
01: 05: 09,160 -> 01: 05: 12,120
You are a traitor and a heretic!

655
01: 05: 12,120 -> 01: 05: 14,960
You have heard testimony
honest of these witnesses.

656
01: 05: 15,000 -> 01: 05: 17,120
May I say something
as my defense?

657
01: 05: 17,160 -> 01: 05: 21,080
I can kill you at
where you stand

658
01: 05: 21,120 -> 01: 05: 28,760
But because we want to prove us
well, so we will listen

659
01: 05: 28,800 -> 01: 05: 35,280
First, I want to direct
statement to Mr. Iri Hati

660
01: 05: 37,200 -> 01: 05: 43,560
All I can say is,
law, regulations, habits

661
01: 05: 43,560 -> 01: 05: 47,080
who clearly fought back
The Word of God,

662
01: 05: 47,080 -> 01: 05: 50,760
They clearly fight
Christianity

663
01: 05: 50,280 -> 01: 05: 53,000
If that is not true, show it
where is my fault

664
01: 05: 53,040 -> 01: 05: 55,000
and I will apologize

665
01: 05: 55,040 -> 01: 06: 01,560
Like allegations from superstition
all I can say is:

666
01: 06: 04,520 -> 01: 06: 07,760
All worship is built
faith in yourself

667
01: 06: 07,760 -> 01: 06: 12,040
and not on faith in the Lord
means nothing.

668
01: 06: 12,680 -> 01: 06: 17,880
As for the words of Mr.
Persuade, this is what I will say:

669
01: 06: 17,880 -> 01: 06: 22,640
Prince of this city
and those who serve it

670
01: 06: 22,640 -> 01: 06: 25,960
More suitable to serve in hell

671
01: 06: 26,960 -> 01: 06: 30,680
rather than serving this city,
or this country.

672
01: 06: 30,680 -> 01: 06: 33,280
You have closed your destiny
in your own words!

673
01: 06: 33,280 -> 01: 06: 34,400
Burn him!

674
01: 06: 36,400 -> 01: 06: 38,120
- listen
- All is well.

675
01: 06: 38,120 -> 01: 06: 40,800
Be strong. The evangelist said
this will happen

676
01: 06: 40,800 -> 01: 06: 46,320
It seems like I arrived in the City
Eternal before you

677
01: 06: 46,360 -> 01: 06: 52,040
- I will meet you in the Baka Kingdom!
- Be strong, Faithful!

678
01: 06: 52,080 -> 01: 06: 55,840
Where is your defense now,
Faithful?

679
01: 07: 13,480 -> 01: 07: 16,360
You are next.

680
01: 07: 48,560 -> 01: 07: 57,000
Forgive them, Father!
They don't know what they are doing.

681
01: 08: 14,400 -> 01: 08: 22,760
Christian, come with me!
fast!

682
01: 08: 30,720 -> 01: 08: 36,800
"In my dream, I saw Faithful die
for bearing witness to the truth. "

683
01: 08: 36,840 -> 01: 08: 40,160
But his testimony helped
others, push

684
01: 08: 41,200 -> 01: 08: 44,720
they start the journey
to Eternal City

685
01: 08: 44,720 -> 01: 08: 49,920
"I can see Faithful flying
in the clouds with a train of fire "

686
01: 08: 49,920 -> 01: 08: 53,680
Faithful, He will be a person
first to enter the gates of heaven

687
01: 08: 53,720 -> 01: 08: 58,680
I will meet you in the Eternal City,
my best friend !

688
01: 08: 58,720 -> 01: 09: 03,680
"Now I see in my dreams
Christian with his new friend, Full of Hope. "

689
01: 09: 03,800 -> 01: 09: 07,760
move fast on the track,

690
01: 09: 07,760 -> 01: 09: 11,280
"until rocky and difficult
for their feet. "

691
01: 09: 11,280 -> 01: 09: 16,880
They start hoping if only
the path will get easier.

692
01: 09: 18,920 -> 01: 09: 21,160
Look at that !

693
01: 09: 32,840 -> 01: 09: 38,520
- Maybe this is the way
- What if it leads off the track?

694
01: 09: 38,560 -> 01: 09: 42,640
This is not possible.
We are in the same direction.

695
01: 09: 47,200 -> 01: 09: 53,480
Hello!
Where is the road going?

696
01: 09: 55,520 -> 01: 10: 01,960
To the Eternal City.

697
01: 10: 03,480 -> 01: 10: 07,440
Come on, it's gonna be alright!

698
1:10: 07,480 -> 01: 10: 13,800
They only know a little that people
those who follow are named Too Confident.

699
1:10: 13,920 -> 01: 10: 20,720
He was never seen and
heard again.

700
01: 10: 29,680 -> 01: 10: 31,920
When evening arrives,

701
01: 10: 31,920 -> 01: 10: 36,600
Christian and Hopeful looking
place to rest.

702
01: 10: 44,560 -> 01: 10: 49,120
You! enter without my regional permission!

703
01: 10: 49,160 -> 01: 10: 51,720
No, sorry.
We don't mean that ...

704
01: 10: 51,760 -> 01: 10: 56,240
Shut up !
You must come with me!

705
01: 10: 56,280 -> 01: 11: 02,280
"In my dream I saw a giant
Despair brings Christianity and full of hope

706
01: 11: 02,800 -> 01: 11: 04,480
to the Palace of Doubt

707
01: 11: 04,480 -> 01: 11: 10,000
where the traveler is disobedient
never heard of again

708
01: 11: 12,320 -> 01: 11: 16,360
I'm full of death
that is terrible.

709
01: 11: 16,400 -> 01: 11: 19,760
Christian and full of hope not given
food or drink.

710
01: 11: 19,800 -> 01: 11: 22,840
days passed like years.

711
01: 11: 22,880 -> 01: 11: 32,320
Strength starts to fade, with
remaining hope to be free

712
01: 11: 34,400 -> 01: 11: 37,920
My wife has a good idea tonight
yesterday.

713
01: 11: 37,960 -> 01: 11: 44,720
He advised meto give
you misfortune over your life

714
01: 11: 45,520 -> 01: 11: 47,200
Have mercy!
Let us go!

715
01: 11: 47,240 -> 01: 11: 52,600
Let you go?
Let you go die here!

716
01: 12: 11,400 -> 01: 12: 14,480
my wife,
thankful he is kind

717
01: 12: 14,560 -> 01: 12: 22,960
advise, because you always get
miserable, suicide is the only way.

718
01: 12: 23,000 -> 01: 12: 28,360
So he provides you a lot
selection

719
01: 12: 28,360 -> 01: 12: 33,480
to end your life
this meaningless

720
01: 12: 33,480 -> 01: 12: 39,960
now, first?

721
01: 12: 40,000 -> 01: 12: 44,360
Sir, can you leave us alone
go away? no one knows

722
01: 13: 38,360 -> 01: 13: 43,560
- Do not do it !
- Why not ?

723
01: 13: 43,800 -> 01: 13: 48,280
I better hang myself than
go through the days in this hell hole

724
01: 13: 48,320 -> 01: 13: 54,040
I agree, death is better than life
here

725
01: 13: 55,080 -> 01: 14: 00,480
Remember that GOD is greater than
every giant we face

726
01: 14: 00,520 -> 01: 14: 05,520
We can go through this.

727
01: 14: 17,840 -> 01: 14: 21,120
The two men survived on
the next day.

728
01: 14: 21,120 -> 01: 14: 25,280
They are hard to move,
but they are still alive.

729
01: 14: 32,440 -> 01: 14: 36,720
I see you don't
obey my good advice.

730
01: 14: 36,760 -> 01: 14: 41,920
Now, I will obey your wishes
you will never be born

731
01: 14: 41,920 -> 01: 14: 46,760
Tomorrow I will tear you up.

732
01: 14: 51,600 -> 01: 14: 55,320
We must end everything

733
01: 14: 55,320 -> 01: 15: 01,200
Remember how handsome you were
face the great Apolion

734
01: 15: 01,200 -> 01:15: 04,600
and how is the LORD
give you victory,

735
01: 15: 05,840 -> 01:15: 12,720
and face ferocious animals,
in the Valley of Death?

736
01: 15: 12,720 -> 01: 15: 17,120
Let's not forget what is
God has done it for us!

737
01: 15: 17,120 -> 01: 15: 24,800
Let's wait for him and see
What will she do.

738
01: 15: 24,840 -> 01:15: 29,760
thank you

739
01: 15: 43,880 -> 01:15: 49,720
All I can see is the body
scattered

740
01:15: 49,720 -> 01:15: 54,000
- I know what you have to do.
- What is that ?

741
01: 15: 54,040 -> 01:15: 58,920
- pray.
- Good idea.

742
01: 15: 59,920 -> 01: 16: 02,800
Something we should
do it first

743
01: 16: 02,840 -> 01: 16: 06,760
Time will be over
for both travelers.

744
01: 16: 06,760 -> 01: 16: 09,160
You say you will
scatter their bodies

745
01: 16: 09,160 -> 01: 16: 14,520
Not now,
I am eating

746
01: 16: 14,080 -> 01: 16: 18,520
GOD Jesus, We are grateful
for your love and loyalty

747
01: 16: 21,520 -> 01: 16: 26,880
You say if there are two people
gather in your name, you are present.

748
01: 16: 26,880 -> 01: 16: 32,960
We are grateful for your help
and because you heard our prayer.

749
01: 16: 34,000 -> 01: 16: 39,200
Heavenly Father, Please find us
get out of this place!

750
01: 16: 58,360 -> 01: 17: 02,960
This is the key to the Promise
given to me on that cross.

751
01: 17: 02,960 -> 01: 17: 07,720
I'm sure this can unlock
in this Palace of doubt

752
01: 17: 29,840 -> 01: 17: 36,000
- Christian, come on!
<i> - no, no, no! </ i>

753
01: 17: 36,120 -> 01: 17: 43,920
- Come on!
<i> - No, no! </ i>

754
01: 17: 47,720 -> 01: 17: 50,960
"I see now Christian
and Full of Hope returns to. "

755
01: 17: 50,960 -> 01: 17: 55,160
the path to Heaven, they
make a sign to prevent

756
01: 17: 55,160 -> 01: 18: 00,160
upcoming traveler, so no
fell into the hands of Giant Despair

757
01: 18: 00,160 -> 01: 18: 06,280
Their journey continues
towards Mount Happiness

758
01: 18: 07,320 -> 01: 18: 11,320
- Good afternoon !
- Good afternoon all.

759
01: 18: 11,320 -> 01: 18: 15,920
Tell us ! Who owns it
this beautiful mountain and meadow?

760
01: 18: 15,920 -> 01: 18: 22,040
This mountain belongs to Immanuel.
Who is in the City

761
01: 18: 22,040 -> 01: 18: 26,520
These sheep to whom he gave
His life, belongs to Him too.

762
01: 18: 26,520 -> 01: 18: 29,800
Is the Eternal City far from here?

763
01: 18: 29,800 -> 01: 18: 35,800
Too far for some people but
for people who really want to go there, no.

764
01: 18: 35,800 -> 01: 18: 38,640
What can you say
will we face on the road?

765
01: 18: 38,680 -> 01: 18: 42,600
Safe for those who
true to Immanuel,

766
01: 18: 42,600 -> 01: 18: 46,440
But death for those who don't.

767
01: 18: 46,640 -> 01: 18: 50,720
Um ... this trip is long
and tiring

768
01: 18: 50,720 -> 01: 18: 53,520
Do you mind if we
stop and take a break?

769
01: 18: 53,520 -> 01: 18: 57,600
TUAN this place said to us
so as not to forget to entertain strangers

770
01: 18: 57,600-> 01: 19: 03,240
You can rest here. But before,
much to show you

771
01: 19: 12,240 -> 01: 19: 21,760
This place is Mount Eroer.
Do you see people die there?

772
01: 19: 24,800 -> 01: 19: 26,840
Why aren't they buried?

773
01: 19: 26,880 -> 01: 19: 30,240
They are examples, warn
those who lost their way

774
01: 19: 30,280 -> 01: 19: 34,240
because of heresy
about resurrection.

775
01: 19: 34,280 -> 01: 19: 39,040
Remember the truth
Jesus has risen!

776
01: 19: 55,120 -> 01: 20: 02,080
This is Mount Be careful.
There in the distance, do you see them?

777
01: 20: 02,120 -> 01:20: 04,480
They are travelers like you

778
01: 20: 04,520 -> 01: 20: 07,320
Do you pay attention wrongly
the one who passed on your trip?

779
01: 20: 07,360 -> 01: 20: 12,520
unfortunately, they left the track &
take the middle ground to make it easier.

780
01: 20: 12,560 -> 01:20: 15,040
They were captured by the Giants
Despair.

781
01: 20: 15,080 -> 01:20: 20,320
He blinds them, causes them,
wandering in the cemetery, fulfilling Proverbs:

782
01: 20: 20,360 -> 01:20: 23,960
<i> the person who left the road
understanding </ i>

783
01: 20: 23,960 -> 01:20: 28,480
<i> come to the group
dead people "</ i>

784
01: 20: 46,760 -> 01: 20: 54,000
Watch your step ! This is
shortcut to hell

785
01: 20: 54,040 -> 01: 21: 00,280
The place of hypocrites like
Esau, who sold his birthright,

786
1: 21: 00,280 -> 01: 21: 03,720
like Judas, who sold his master

787
01: 21: 03,720 -> 01: 21: 07,520
and Alexander who insulted the gospel ...

788
1: 21: 07,520 -> 01: 21: 11,640
Are those who are here
on the way to Eternal City?

789
01: 21: 11,680 -> 01: 21: 15,880
They believe that,
until it ends here

790
01: 21: 38,520 -> 01: 21: 43,640
This hill is quite clear

791
01: 21: 43,680 -> 01: 21: 52,160
There. maybe you can see
the longing of your heart, the Eternal City Gate

792
01: 21: 52,200 -> 01: 21: 56,120
Where is the King waiting
His faithful people

793
01: 22: 16,960 -> 01: 22: 22,720
So beautiful !

794
01: 22: 22,760 -> 01: 22: 28,040
After refreshing and spending
time with the shepherd talk about the LORD

795
01: 22: 28,080 -> 01: 22: 35,040
and His way, Christian and Full of Hope
ready to continue the journey

796
01: 22: 35,080 -> 01: 22: 41,120
- Thank you for the map.
- Oh and remember, be aware of seduction.

797
01: 22: 41,160 -> 01: 22: 44,800
Don't say anything
keep you off track

798
01: 22: 44,840 -> 01: 22: 48,360
and don't slip on
Enchanting Mainland!

799
01: 22: 48,400 -> 01: 22: 52,320
Thank you for everything

800
01: 22: 52,320 -> 01: 22: 55,960
When I dreamed, I saw Christianity and
Hopeful now in the country

801
01: 22: 56,000 -> 01: 23: 01,360
which is called Pride, where
they will meet a young man,

802
01: 23: 01,360 -> 01: 23: 07,200
named Ignorance, make
the path itself in the journey.

803
01: 23: 07,240 -> 01: 23: 10,720
- Afternoon, friend!
- Hi !

804
01: 23: 10,760 -> 01: 23: 13,120
From where ?
Where are you going ?

805
01: 23: 13,120 -> 01: 23: 19,640
From the area there, but moved.
and I went to Eternal City.

806
01: 23: 19,680 -> 01: 23: 23,520
Are you through the door?
Do you have this?

807
01: 23: 23,520 -> 01: 23: 29,920
Oh, that's funny, silly!
No, no, nothing.

808
01: 23: 29,960 -> 01: 23: 34,240
But, you need this
to enter the City!

809
01: 23: 34,280 -> 01: 23: 40,680
No, it will be fine. To be able to live:
pray, kindness, give alms,

810
01: 23: 40,720 -> 01: 23: 46,360
I sacrificed everything on
my country to enter the Eternal City

811
01: 23: 46,400 -> 01: 23: 50,120
Yes, they will let me in.

812
01: 23: 50,120 -> 01: 23: 53,480
Alright, the journey starts at the gate

813
01: 23: 53,520 -> 01: 23: 56,280
Without this you cannot enter.

814
01: 23: 56,320 -> 01: 24: 01,800
Yes, and this is not about you. They
it won't let you into the City.

815
01: 24: 01,840 -> 01: 24: 05,160
Okay, we'll see
By the way, it's pretty beautiful here

816
01: 24: 05,200 -> 01: 24: 09,880
So I will sit for a moment.
We will meet in front

817
1: 24: 09,920 -> 01: 24: 15,920
Good, nice to talk to you.
We walk first.

818
1: 24: 15,920 -> 01: 24: 18,920
yes

819
01: 24: 27,040 -> 01: 24: 29,720
I don't understand what was said.

820
01: 24: 29,760 -> 01: 24: 34,120
We have done everything
we can, we have shared faith.

821
01: 24: 34,120 -> 01: 24: 39,920
We only need to give time
so he thinks about it

822
01: 25: 00,920 -> 01: 25: 09,120
I know him.
His name is Small Faith

823
01: 25: 21,120 -> 01: 25: 26,840
- They go to hell shortcuts huh?
- yes.

824
01: 25: 40,720 -> 01: 25: 44,000
It looks like the road is divided in two.
We can come here and there.

825
01: 25: 44,040 -> 01: 25: 48,280
- What would you do ?
- I am not sure.

826
01: 25: 48,320 -> 01: 25: 51,120
Like itthe road is narrow
it's on the left.

827
01: 25: 54,360 -> 01: 25: 56,720
I think that he is the one who shines

828
01: 26: 00,480 -> 01: 26: 07,160
- Friend, what's your problem?
- We are on our way to Eternal City

829
01: 26: 07,200 -> 01: 26: 10,840
and we are not sure of the way
which one to take

830
01: 26: 10,880 -> 01: 26: 14,400
In fact, the path starts to appear
confusing at this point

831
01: 26: 14,440 -> 01: 26: 18,360
Maybe it's not accidental we met,
because I help a lot of travelers

832
01: 26: 18,400 -> 01: 26: 24,000
on their way
towards the Eternal City.

833
01: 26: 24,040 -> 01: 26: 27,400
Let me try
help you too

834
01: 26: 27,440 -> 01: 26: 34,080
- Sir, is it far from here?
- No, closer than thought.

835
01: 26: 38,040 -> 01: 26: 38,920
- This is great.
- We're almost there.

836
01: 26: 42,160 -> 01: 26: 45,520
Becoming Christian and Full of Hope followed
people who praise their strength

837
01: 26: 45,520 -> 01: 26: 53,160
wisdom, and faith because it has
until this far

838
01: 26: 53,200 -> 01: 27: 02,000
As they walked, they realized slowly
they deviated from the path of the Eternal City

839
01: 27: 02,040 -> 01: 27: 11,280
This doesn't look good. I think he brought it
we are back on our way to come

840
01: 27: 11,320 -> 01:27: 19,120
Excuse me, are you sure
is this the right way?

841
01: 27: 38,440 -> 01: 27: 43,240
I should know, shepherd
tell me there is an Instigator.

842
01: 27: 43,280 -> 01:27: 45,360
Now I know what Proverbs means,

843
01: 27: 45,400 -> 01: 27: 49,320
<i> "One who deceives his fellow man </ i>
put a net on his feet. "

844
01: 27: 49,360 -> 01: 27: 54,840
If only we saw the map,
I know the answer is there.

845
01: 28: 00,360 -> 01: 28: 03,360
Christian and full of hope
fight for hours,

846
01: 28: 03,400 -> 01: 28: 07,360
but it is impossible for them
to get out of the net

847
01: 28: 07,400 -> 01: 28: 12,000
They think if only
their journey is over

848
01: 28: 12,040 -> 01: 28: 19,920
And I see the shining one
actually came to save

849
01: 28: 27,440 -> 01: 28: 31,560
The Shining ones reprimand them
for following the Instigator

850
01: 28: 31,600 -> 01: 28: 36,560
and don't follow that map
the shepherds give

851
01: 28: 36,600 -> 01: 28: 47,200
Then, after the direction, He brought Christianity
& Hopeful return to the road to Heaven

852
01: 28: 48,240 -> 01: 28: 56,720
- Is he still following us?
- as expected.

853
01: 28: 56,720 -> 01: 29: 02,240
This is interesting. This person seems to be
leave the Eternal City

854
01: 29: 02,280 -> 01: 29: 05,000
It's better to be careful.
He might be an Instigator

855
01: 29: 05,040 -> 01: 29: 08,800
Good morning friends !
Where are you going?

856
01: 29: 08,800 -> 01: 29: 11,760
we are travelers and inside
trip to Eternal City

857
01: 29: 15,320 -> 01: 29: 22,240
Oh sorry, it's been a long time since me
see people like you,

858
01: 29: 22,240 -> 01: 29: 24,760
risking life and body
for something that doesn't exist

859
01: 29: 24,800 -> 01: 29: 27,240
Do you say we don't
will it be allowed to enter the City?

860
01: 29: 27,280 -> 01: 29: 31,320
What should I say
is that City is nowhere

861
01: 29: 31,320 -> 01: 29: 34,120
We hear and believe that
such a place does exist.

862
01: 29: 34,160 -> 01: 29: 38,120
I also heard about
the place that started this in my country

863
01: 29: 38,120 -> 01: 29: 42,360
and, like you, I left
everything and look for it,

864
01: 29: 42,360 -> 01: 29: 44,920
But after looking for it for years
year, I came to consciousness:

865
01: 29: 44,960 -> 01: 29: 51,680
there is no City
and there is no LORD

866
01: 29: 51,720 -> 01: 29: 58,840
So I went home, wanting to refresh myself
world enjoyment, as I said.

867
01: 29: 58,880 -> 01: 30: 02,160
You must do the same,
daagh.

868
01: 30: 07,160 -> 01: 30: 13,080
He is so close!
come on!

869
01: 30: 13,120 -> 01: 30: 16,920
- We can't do anything for him.
- you are right

870
01: 30: 16,920 -> 01: 30: 20,560
Now in my dreams, I see
Christian & Hopeful arrived in the country

871
01: 30: 20,600 -> 01: 30: 27,920
where the air makes you sleepy,
making them difficult to walk

872
01: 30: 54,840 -> 01: 31: 00,480
I am very tired !
I can sleep standing up.

873
01: 31: 05,120 -> 01: 31: 12,440
We can go to the tree ... and sleep
just one hour there?

874
01: 31: 12,480 -> 01: 31: 19,040
- No, we don't have to keep going.
- Half an hour...

875
01: 31: 25,480 -> 01: 31: 30,360
- 30 minutes.
- Must keep going.

876
01: 31: 30,400 -> 01: 31: 37,240
are you tired!
Oh, we have to keep going.

877
01: 31: 38,280 -> 01: 31: 44,760
wait, remember the story of the shepherds,
about Enchanting Mainland?

878
01: 31: 44,800 -> 01: 31: 45,800
Yes.

879
01: 31: 45,840 -> 01: 31: 51,280
This must be the place.
Ok, we can't sleep.

880
01: 31: 51,320 -> 01: 31: 54,720
dan we must stay focused.
come on!

881
01: 31: 54,720 -> 01: 31: 58,920
If we sleep now,
We might not be able to wake up.

882
01: 31: 58,920 -> 01: 32: 05,920
Glad you are with me.
I will not fall asleep if with you.

883
01: 32: 05,960 -> 01: 32: 11,320
True to what Proverbs said,
<i> "Both are better than one." </ i>

884
01: 32: 11,360 -> 01: 32: 13,920
and you are friends
which is good for me. it is good

885
01: 32: 13,960 -> 01: 32: 17,360
Hey, you can do it.
You must stay awake

886
01: 32: 17,400 -> 01: 32: 19,920
- Ready?
- yes, yes

887
01: 32: 19,920 -> 01: 32: 24,080
Tell me why you decided
go and be a traveler

888
01: 32: 24,120 -> 01: 32: 26,160
I want to save my soul

889
01: 32: 26,200 -> 01: 32: 33,360
yes, it's much better.
Come on, keep talking!

890
01: 32: 33,400 -> 01: 32: 37,920
I like someone else on Pasar Kesia-
Siaan. Enjoy all the fun.

891
01: 32: 37,920 -> 01: 32: 40,960
But I know on
finally, it destroyed me.

892
01: 32: 41,000 -> 01: 32: 47,920
- Like what ?
- I like it all,

893
01: 32: 53,400 -> 01: 32: 56,200
I never felt enough

894
1: 32: 56,920 -> 01: 33: 00,040
I realized death was waiting
disobedient children

895
01: 33: 00,080 -> 01: 33: 03,240
- So your mind punishes you?
- I fight it.

896
01: 33: 03,280 -> 01: 33: 09,320
I see my sin is so evil
so that sentenced me to hell.

897
01: 33: 09,320 -> 01: 33: 12,240
I began investigating the Bible
and seek His righteousness.

898
01: 33: 12,280 -> 01: 33: 14,040
- How come ?

899
01: 33: 14,080 -> 01: 33: 18,120
The Lord keeps giving me a sign,
The servant of the Lord is on the way ...

900
01: 33: 18,120 -> 01: 33: 19,720
Friend, I'm begging you

901
01: 33: 19,720 -> 01: 33: 23,960
Jesus Christ said if you
do not repent, you will perish,

902
01: 33: 23,000 -> 01: 33: 27,680
I have a friend who died.

903
01: 33: 27,720 -> 01: 33: 31,800
And if I die,
I will be judged soon

904
01: 33: 31,840 -> 01: 33: 36,520
- That will change someone's life
- I tried to change my paths

905
01: 33: 36,560 -> 01: 33: 40,560
I run away from my sinful life
Run away from my sinful friends

906
01: 33: 40,600 -> 01: 33: 44,960
I become spiritual,
I pray, I read the Bible

907
01: 33: 45,000 -> 01: 33: 51,440
I mourn for my sin.
I share the truth.

908
01: 33: 51,480 -> 01: 33: 54,360
- Looks like you found safety
- There is one problem

909
01: 33: 54,360 -> 01: 33: 57,520
I can't reach it until I read on
Bible, we cannot know God through

910
01: 33: 57,640 -> 01: 34: 01,560
the work of the Lord, but through
personal relationship with Christ

911
01: 34: 01,600 -> 01: 34: 03,560
others can't.

912
01: 34: 03,600 -> 01: 34: 11,240
- And what are you doing?
- On the contrary, what Jesus did.

913
01: 34: 15,680 -> 01: 34: 20,320
<i> Believe in Jesus Christ </ i>
and you will be saved.

914
01: 34: 20,320 -> 01: 34: 23,080
Lord, how are you
forgive sinners like me?

915
01: 34: 23,120 -> 01: 34: 30,000
- My grace is enough for you.
- You don't know, My sins are big.

916
01: 34: 30,040 -> 01: 34: 33,160
"The person who came to me
I will not throw it away. "

917
01: 34: 33,200 -> 01: 34: 40,360
- I would never even refuse. "
- Even a sinner like me?

918
01: 34: 40,400 -> 01: 34: 42,840
"I came to the world to
save sinners. "

919
01: 34: 42,880 -> 01: 34: 47,120
I am the fulness of the Law
for those who believe.

920
01: 34: 47,160 -> 01: 34: 51,560
I died for the sins of the world and rose
for everyone's justification.

921
01: 34: 51,600 -> 01: 34: 57,080
I love everyone, I wash
all the sins of the world with my blood

922
01: 34: 57,120 -> 01: 35: 00,680
I am the intermediary between
man and GOD

923
01: 35: 00,720 -> 01: 35: 06,720
and finally I fell in love with Jesus,
His people and His ways.

924
01: 35: 06,760 -> 01: 35: 12,400
they keep themselves awake, tell about
The LORD Jesus and His great love

925
01: 35: 12,440 -> 01: 35: 17,440
before they know that
they made it through the Enchanting Mainland.

926
01: 35: 17,480 -> 01: 35: 23,080
Christian and full of hope now
enter Beulah's land, where the air is cool,

927
01: 35: 23,120 -> 01: 35: 28,320
a place very close to Eternal City
where the usual shine goes

928
01: 35: 28,360 -> 01: 35: 32,720
through parks and vineyards.

929
01: 35: 37,320 -> 01: 35: 39,520
- Good day sir !
- Hello!

930
01: 35: 39,520 -> 01: 35: 42,480
Tell me, garden and garden
Whose wine is this?

931
01: 35: 42,520 -> 01: 35: 47,920
All belong to the King. Planted for
His likes and travelers

932
01: 35: 48,040 -> 01: 35: 53,280
to make your trip comfortable.
Serve what you want!

933
01: 35: 53,320 -> 01: 36: 02,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

934
01: 36: 08,960 -> 01: 36: 14,040
After Christian and Full of Hope enjoy
enough food & a few days rest

935
01: 36: 14,080 ->01: 36: 18,920
They are ready for
continue the journey.

936
01: 36: 18,960 -> 01: 36: 22,720
Just a walk
to the Permanent River

937
01: 36: 22,760 -> 01: 36: 31,560
they are approaching the end of the journey
and their hearts long to see the King himself

938
01: 36: 35,200 -> 01: 36: 40,520
Only two difficulties remain
between you and the Eternal City

939
01: 36: 40,520 -> 01: 36: 44,160
Is a boat or a bridge
to cross?

940
01: 36: 44,200 -> 01: 36: 49,200
No, this is the only way
you go into the city

941
01: 36: 49,240 -> 01: 36: 52,240
Is the river within?

942
01: 36: 52,280 -> 01: 36: 59,320
Depends on how you are
believe in the King of this place.

943
01: 36: 59,360 -> 01: 37: 05,760
- Are you ready for a friend?
- I'm ready.

944
01: 37: 36,080 -> 01: 37: 42,200
The river becomes deep
and the water is hardened.

945
01: 37: 42,240 -> 01: 37: 46,720
it was the last attempt of the evil one
to stop them

946
01: 37: 46,720 -> 01: 37: 50,360
Their mind is headed
to the previous sins

947
01: 37: 50,400 -> 01: 37: 57,120
- We can not achieve it!
- I see that shine on the Gate!

948
01: 37: 57,160 -> 01: 37: 59,520
I'm waiting for you, Hope!

949
01: 37: 59,520 -> 01: 38: 03,000
- My dose is interesting to me.

950
01: 38: 03,000 -> 01: 38: 07,840
- Remember that Jesus'
cleanse you from your sin.

951
01: 38: 08,000 -> 01: 38: 12,520
They feel unworthy
to enter in the presence of the King

952
01: 38: 12,560 -> 01: 38: 20,560
The mind of sin, the past sweeps away
and bring them into the water

953
01: 38: 21,440 -> 01: 38: 25,120
The Christian mind began to sink
doubt and can not

954
01: 38: 25,160 -> 01: 38: 29,240
considering a promise
which the Lord has given.

955
01: 38: 29,280 -> 01: 38: 34,200
But Full of Hope remember
Jesus has restored everything.

956
01: 38: 34,240 -> 01: 38: 40,280
His dosage was washed
He is a new creation.

957
01: 39: 25,920 -> 01: 39: 29,960
I was sent to serve them
who inherited safety.

958
01: 39: 30,000 -> 01: 39: 36,160
Please, can you point out
my wife and children walk?

959
01: 39: 36,160 -> 01: 39: 38,480
The King has heard your prayers

960
01: 39: 38,480 -> 01: 39: 44,480
He sent his wife and
your kids invite.

961
01: 39: 49,120 -> 01: 39: 52,240
Thank you.

962
01: 40: 13,200 -> 01: 40: 17,280
Now in my dream, me
look at Christianity and Hope

963
01: 40: 17,280 -> 01: 40: 21,400
welcomed by the angels
shining in the gates of heaven

964
01: 40: 32,960 -> 01: 40: 39,160
They are welcomed into the presence
The Lord Jesus who welcomes them,

965
01: 40: 39,200 -> 01: 40: 48,560
said, "Well done,
Hi my good and faithful slave. "

966
01: 40: 48,600 -> 01: 40: 53,800
When I saw all this, I did
Turn around and I see the Panic

967
01: 40: 53,840 -> 01: 40: 59,560
carried across the river by
Hope Sia-Sia, with some difficulty.

968
01: 40: 59,600 -> 01: 41: 06,920
After crossing, nobody
at the Gate of Eternal City to welcome it

969
01: 41: 17,240 -> 01: 41: 24,680
Hello!

970
01: 41: 26,720 -> 01: 41: 37,960
- Where are you and what do you want?
- I have eaten and drank in the presence of the King

971
01: 41: 38,000 -> 01: 41: 43,720
He was taught in our streets,
So here I am.

972
01: 41: 43,760 -> 01: 41: 53,440
Where is your certificate?
Do not you have a certificate?

973
01: 41: 53,480 -> 01: 42: 02,600
Ah, funny story ...
Uh ... Hey, all right ..

974
01: 42: 04,680 -> 01: 42: 07,520
what are you doing
Release me!

975
01: 42: 07,600 -> 01: 42: 12,120
I have seen the King!
Help !

976
01: 42: 12,120 -> 01: 42: 20,160
Then I see there is a way to hell
even in front of the Gate of Heaven

977
01: 42: 20,200 -> 01: 42: 26,440
"Then I woke up and
it turns out all was a dream ... "

978
01: 42: 53,520 -> 01: 43: 00,160
We are on the same journey.
Are you in the right way?

979
01: 43: 06,160 -> 01: 43: 10,160
