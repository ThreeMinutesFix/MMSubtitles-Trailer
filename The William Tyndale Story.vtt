WEBVTT

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:15.038
The year was 1525.

00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:17.907
There was one official church.

00:00:17.927 --> 00:00:21.277
All religious writings and
ceremonies were in Latin,

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:24.681
a language not understood by
most of the people.

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.584
The translation and
distribution of the Bible in
English

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.385
had been outlawed;

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:32.322
a crime punishable by death.

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:34.657
Driven by the idea that God
meant all people

00:00:34.677 --> 00:00:36.926
to understand His word plainly,

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:40.330
some men risked their lives and
worked tirelessly

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.767
to translate the Bible into the
common language.

00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:46.069
Such a man was...

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.005
William Tyndale.

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:50.573
William! We are discovered!

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:52.108
What? How?

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:53.576
I've made arrangements for the
next ship!

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:54.978
We must leave!

00:00:54.998 --> 00:00:56.546
The Old Testament translations!

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.282
Not one note must be left
behind!

00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:00.850
Make haste!

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750
Follow me!

00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:11.261
I want anyone caught in
possession of these books

00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:15.365
to be arrested and tried... for
heresy!

00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:19.302
Burn every book, every page,
every piece of paper

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:21.704
that has so much as a remnant
of it!

00:01:21.724 --> 00:01:24.073
William Tyndale...

00:01:24.093 --> 00:01:27.076
I shall have my way with you...

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:29.670
wherever you might be!

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.909
ta npobata ta elia...

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.216
...speech...no...voice!

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:16.025
And I recognize... No! Not
recognize.

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:26.026
And I - Yes! My sheep...
hear...my voice...

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:44.153
Finished!

00:02:44.173 --> 00:02:47.023
Good! Our dinner guest will be
here shortly...

00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:51.861
and Lady Ann and I would like
you to join us.

00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:54.063
Sir John! Come in, come in!

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.865
I see our children's tutor

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:58.601
is hard at work during his
spare time.

00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:01.671
Now, tell me...what did you
finish during these hours?

00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:03.039
A Gospel?

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.507
Would that were the case!

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:09.012
But...no, I just finished
translating one more sentence.

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:10.280
I see!

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.614
It is Scripture.

00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:13.809
It must be done just right!

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.554
"My sheep hear my voice

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:21.958
and I know them and they follow
me."

00:03:21.978 --> 00:03:23.259
Surely, Sir John...

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:25.528
we are to understand as well as
hear!

00:03:25.548 --> 00:03:27.096
Surely the common people...

00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:30.333
I know - "They must have the
Scriptures!"

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:33.636
Yes! ln English and not just
Latin.

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:36.406
I suppose you will tell me to
be cautious.

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:41.110
I admire your courage,
William...

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.378
and your knowledge

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:45.615
which is why I have asked you
to tutor my children.

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:48.851
But you must not forget that
teaching the Scriptures

00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:53.423
in English among the people is
against the law.

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:56.292
You are a scholar and as a
study in languages,

00:03:56.312 --> 00:03:58.895
this translation is acceptable-

00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:02.632
but...outside of this room...
well -

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:06.169
these are most uncertain times.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.797
You will recall what happened
in Coventry...

00:04:11.227 --> 00:04:13.476
...and so rains came...

00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:17.213
and the waves rose....
high, high, high...

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:22.251
but the wise man's house stood
strong!

00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:26.389
But the foolish man did not do
as Jesus told him...

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.525
and so when the storm blew,

00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:33.429
the foolish man's house came
down...

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.833
PLUNK!!!

00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:40.136
Tell us another, father!

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:43.506
Oh...please! Just one...one
more!

00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:45.508
Oh...mother says it's off to
bed with you!

00:04:45.528 --> 00:04:48.678
Now...let's gather round and
ask God's blessing.

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:52.181
Peter, head bowed! Good boy!

00:04:52.201 --> 00:04:56.252
Our Father in heaven, Hallowed
be Thy Name,

00:04:56.272 --> 00:05:00.590
May Thy Kingdom come, Thy will
be done,

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.387
upon this earth as it is in...

00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:13.369
Your activities have been
reported!

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.272
By the authority of the holy
mother church

00:05:16.292 --> 00:05:20.276
you are hereby arrested for the
offense of reciting and teaching

00:05:20.296 --> 00:05:24.047
the Lord's Prayer in the
English language

00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:25.715
and for this crime...

00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:27.483
you shall be punished by
death...

00:05:27.503 --> 00:05:28.918
No! John!

00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:31.687
and burned at the stake.

00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:34.424
Father!... Leave him alone!...
Stop!

00:05:34.444 --> 00:05:35.982
Richard- no!

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:41.358
No! John!

00:05:47.523 --> 00:05:49.205
So it is with anyone

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:51.574
caught circulating the
Scriptures in English -

00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:53.342
trial by fire!

00:05:53.362 --> 00:05:56.579
And so light must be brought by
one means or another, Sir John.

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.782
The word of God is a light unto
our path.

00:05:59.802 --> 00:06:01.818
It is for all the people to
understand

00:06:01.838 --> 00:06:04.987
and not for the church only.

00:06:05.007 --> 00:06:10.059
Come now...our dinner guest is
waiting.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.226
I repeat...

00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:11.761
I repeat...

00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:13.729
it is the church which has the
authority

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.899
to interpret Sacred Scriptures,
and not the commoners!

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.103
Yet Christ saw fit to teach the
common people, your Grace.

00:06:20.123 --> 00:06:22.738
True! He has a point!

00:06:22.758 --> 00:06:24.941
A point which will prick him.

00:06:24.961 --> 00:06:26.075
And?...

00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:29.512
And Christ said, the Counselor,
the Holy Spirit,

00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:31.981
He will teach you all things.

00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:33.649
And so He does...

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.753
through the church and its
interpretation!

00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:39.188
You're a scholar.

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:41.057
An expert in... five languages?

00:06:41.077 --> 00:06:42.158
Eight!

00:06:42.178 --> 00:06:43.559
Precisely!

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:45.728
Think of the preparation you
have had

00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:47.096
to understand Scripture-

00:06:47.116 --> 00:06:48.531
To translate it.

00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:51.334
The Holy Spirit helps each
person to understand it

00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:53.669
in a way that helps him to
follow God.

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.705
Andrew!

00:06:55.725 --> 00:06:57.540
Sir?

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.377
"non te deseram neque
derelinquam"

00:07:01.397 --> 00:07:04.480
I...beg your pardon, sir?

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.352
Did you know that Jesus said:
"I will always be with you;

00:07:09.372 --> 00:07:11.254
I will never leave you!"

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:13.256
Really, sir?

00:07:13.276 --> 00:07:15.024
That's wonderful!

00:07:15.044 --> 00:07:18.261
I shall remember that, when I
miss my father.

00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:20.563
For heaven's sake! He's a child!

00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:23.132
You know very well that Christ
spoke in parables

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:27.937
difficult to understand... not
in common, plain talk!

00:07:27.957 --> 00:07:30.273
"Woe to you, teachers of the
law,

00:07:30.293 --> 00:07:33.376
for you shut the kingdom of
heaven in men's faces.

00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:36.379
You yourselves do not enter,
nor will you let those enter

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:38.447
who are trying to."

00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:40.383
How plain a Word is that?

00:07:40.403 --> 00:07:41.817
William!

00:07:41.837 --> 00:07:43.653
Forgive me, Lady Ann but it is
important

00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:45.321
to remember that the New
Testament

00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:48.324
was written in the Greek
language, the "Koine"-

00:07:48.344 --> 00:07:50.726
the language of the common
people...

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:52.895
I cannot see how we can take it
upon ourselves

00:07:52.915 --> 00:07:55.031
to withhold something that God

00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:58.768
has so freely and intentionally
given to us all.

00:07:58.788 --> 00:08:03.573
Regardless of whether we judge
anyone to be a simpleton or not.

00:08:03.593 --> 00:08:05.841
Every person is the object

00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:09.078
of Christ's affection and
sacrifice.

00:08:09.098 --> 00:08:11.447
I - I believe our lively
discussion has...

00:08:11.467 --> 00:08:13.683
Ended!

00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:16.052
You may think yourself a bright
scholar

00:08:16.072 --> 00:08:18.454
but you are young and you are
inexperienced!

00:08:18.474 --> 00:08:21.657
If your reckless behavior is
any indication of what would
happen

00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:24.427
should the Word of God get into
the wrong hands...

00:08:24.447 --> 00:08:28.264
...then we were better without
God's Word than the Church's!

00:08:28.284 --> 00:08:30.499
And Sir...

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:35.171
The Bible states "The grass
withers, the flower fades,

00:08:35.191 --> 00:08:39.342
but the word of our God stands
forever."

00:08:39.362 --> 00:08:44.480
If God spare my life, I will
cause a ploughboy

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.149
to know more scripture than the
average priest!

00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:48.484
Oh, William!

00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:50.519
If God spare your life!

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:53.856
Tread carefully, Master
Tyndale...

00:08:53.876 --> 00:09:00.196
the fire is never far... from a
heretic!

00:09:00.216 --> 00:09:02.131
Sir John, Lady Ann...

00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:05.401
your hospitality as usual is
most gratifying.

00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:07.403
Your choice of house guests, I
regret,

00:09:07.423 --> 00:09:09.105
is another matter entirely.

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:10.629
Good evening.

00:09:13.963 --> 00:09:15.945
I fear I have ruined your
dinner!

00:09:15.965 --> 00:09:17.513
Ha! You have ruined his!

00:09:17.533 --> 00:09:19.782
And I enjoyed every minute of
it!

00:09:19.802 --> 00:09:23.319
Though I do agree with the
Archdeacon, William.

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:25.421
You should be careful.

00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:28.324
Should? You must!

00:09:28.344 --> 00:09:29.925
There must be a way to work out
William's vision

00:09:29.945 --> 00:09:32.461
within the Church and thus
avoid danger.

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:34.230
Would there be a way-

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.666
though judging by this evening,
I doubt it.

00:09:36.686 --> 00:09:37.967
Well, I don't.

00:09:37.987 --> 00:09:40.069
Might I suggest a gentleman
known for his love

00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:41.504
of the Scriptures

00:09:41.524 --> 00:09:44.040
as well as his good standing
within the church...

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.574
Doctor Latimer is his name

00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:48.044
and I believe a gentleman of
good counsel.

00:09:48.064 --> 00:09:52.815
I shall be glad to speak to him
on your behalf.

00:09:52.835 --> 00:09:54.850
And so you see my dilemma, Dr.
Latimer!

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.118
In my heart...

00:09:56.138 --> 00:09:58.054
I know that God wants all
people everywhere

00:09:58.074 --> 00:10:00.623
to hear his words plainly,

00:10:00.643 --> 00:10:03.726
and to understand them, but the
church denies me

00:10:03.746 --> 00:10:07.296
the right to make it so...
yet...

00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:09.665
oh sir, there seems no way...

00:10:09.685 --> 00:10:12.435
But there is a way!

00:10:12.455 --> 00:10:13.836
The King?

00:10:13.856 --> 00:10:15.271
Perhaps...

00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:19.875
but...there is yet another step
we can take.

00:10:19.895 --> 00:10:22.978
The Bishop of London!

00:10:22.998 --> 00:10:26.382
He has the authority to
commission a Bible translation?

00:10:26.402 --> 00:10:30.653
Yes, and sponsor you as you do
it!

00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:34.523
That is, if he is willing!

00:10:34.543 --> 00:10:35.858
Oh, sir!

00:10:35.878 --> 00:10:37.660
Lady Ann has contacts in London

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.929
to make the needed arrangements
for your move.

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:42.365
Move?

00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:45.368
but..leave...leave Sir
John and Lady Ann?

00:10:45.388 --> 00:10:47.737
I’m responsible for tutoring
their children, I couldn't-

00:10:47.757 --> 00:10:49.739
And why not?

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:52.975
ls not your vision worth the
cost?

00:10:52.995 --> 00:10:54.977
Listen to me William...

00:10:54.997 --> 00:10:57.780
if you are to pursue this
vision of yours,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.618
you'd do best to prepare for
greater hardships than that!

00:11:02.638 --> 00:11:07.356
And everyone that has forsaken
houses or brethren or lands...

00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:13.429
for My sake and the Gospel's
shall receive a hundredfold...

00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:15.398
Then London it is!

00:11:15.418 --> 00:11:18.595
Perhaps God is opening a door!

00:11:27.596 --> 00:11:30.179
Well...?

00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:33.239
...that bad, eh?

00:11:38.274 --> 00:11:42.191
Now, William... it's not all
that bad is it?

00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.626
How say you?

00:11:43.646 --> 00:11:46.061
I have been here a full month!

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.731
I finally get an appointment to
see My Lord the Bishop

00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:51.534
and his answer is...

00:11:51.554 --> 00:11:52.868
No?

00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:55.271
Oh Will, what is the use!

00:11:55.291 --> 00:11:57.239
I have knocked on doors, I have
begged and pleaded,

00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:00.776
I have pursued every means to
gain the consent of the Church,

00:12:00.796 --> 00:12:04.580
but every door it seems has
been slammed in my face.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.916
So then... what will you do?

00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:12.421
If I cannot do God's work with
the Church's permission...

00:12:12.441 --> 00:12:15.322
then I shall do God's work
without it!

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:22.598
Sir Monmouth!

00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:24.467
Aaauuuggghhh!

00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:27.403
Ah, William!

00:12:27.423 --> 00:12:28.804
You startled me!

00:12:28.824 --> 00:12:30.639
For a moment there I thought
you were-

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:33.375
Oh never mind!

00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:35.945
It's good to see you!

00:12:35.965 --> 00:12:37.813
How was your meeting with the
Bishop?

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:39.748
Not as I had expected.

00:12:39.768 --> 00:12:42.218
Which is why I have come to see
you.

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:45.016
Do you suppose we might have a
word in private?

00:12:50.546 --> 00:12:52.428
So that is how the books are
brought in!

00:12:52.448 --> 00:12:54.864
Sermons from Luther in sacks of
fruit!

00:12:54.884 --> 00:13:00.035
Fruit for the stomach and food
for the soul! Ha!

00:13:00.055 --> 00:13:01.237
But no Bibles!

00:13:01.257 --> 00:13:04.306
No! Not in English, no!

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:06.675
And they can't be printed in
England!

00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:08.777
Not with Wolsey's threat of
burning!

00:13:08.797 --> 00:13:10.212
No, no!

00:13:10.232 --> 00:13:13.782
Then I shall have to go as far
from Wolsey's heat as possible.

00:13:13.802 --> 00:13:15.951
Hmmm?

00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:17.753
Germany!

00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:19.421
Germany!?

00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:21.824
You print and smuggle books
in....

00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:26.896
why can't you smuggle a
slightly larger parcel out?

00:13:26.916 --> 00:13:28.523
You mean y-...?

00:13:31.153 --> 00:13:35.104
Then you best say goodbye to
England forever!

00:13:35.124 --> 00:13:37.740
You will be a hunted fugitive
William -

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.276
The church will not stand for
it...

00:13:40.296 --> 00:13:42.711
and you know they will persuade
the King

00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:45.581
to help them track you down.

00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:48.751
It will be a great price to pay.

00:13:48.771 --> 00:13:52.288
Not any greater than the Lord's
sacrifice for us.

00:13:52.308 --> 00:13:54.483
I am ready!

00:14:00.849 --> 00:14:03.999
With very little money Tyndale
labored tirelessly

00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:06.135
and continued work on the
translation

00:14:06.155 --> 00:14:08.304
of the 27 books of the New
Testament

00:14:08.324 --> 00:14:11.840
which he had begun earlier.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.475
Once in Germany,

00:14:13.495 --> 00:14:16.245
Tyndale's New Testament was
printed in secret

00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:19.806
and the small pocket-sized
books were smuggled into
England.

00:14:24.106 --> 00:14:27.823
I want anyone caught in
possession of these books

00:14:27.843 --> 00:14:31.527
to be arrested and tried... for
heresy!

00:14:31.547 --> 00:14:33.762
The New Testament copies
quickly spread

00:14:33.782 --> 00:14:36.398
causing joy among the people

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:38.867
and alarm among the Church
leaders

00:14:38.887 --> 00:14:41.036
who reacted by writing against
Tyndale

00:14:41.056 --> 00:14:43.272
and denouncing his New
Testament translation

00:14:43.292 --> 00:14:45.641
as filled with errors.

00:14:45.661 --> 00:14:48.143
Reluctantly, William stopped
his translation work

00:14:48.163 --> 00:14:51.046
to reply to his critics and
wrote a book entitled

00:14:51.066 --> 00:14:54.016
"The Obedience of the Christian
Man".

00:14:54.036 --> 00:14:58.087
Burn every book, every page,
every piece of paper

00:14:58.107 --> 00:15:00.856
that has so much as a remnant
of it!

00:15:00.876 --> 00:15:05.461
William Tyndale...I shall have
my way with you...

00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:09.531
wherever you might be!

00:15:09.551 --> 00:15:11.800
"...And God called to him from
within the bush,

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.802
'Moses! Moses!'

00:15:13.822 --> 00:15:16.639
And Moses said, 'Here I am."'

00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:18.440
A wonderful print job, Herr
Peter!

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.043
We shall soon have a goodly
part of the Old Testament
completed!

00:15:21.063 --> 00:15:23.812
And that page will be printed
tonight, as usual,

00:15:23.832 --> 00:15:26.181
but for now...

00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:30.352
it is best kept hidden and away
from prying eyes.

00:15:30.372 --> 00:15:32.121
We may have certain freedoms
here in Germany

00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:34.490
but there are many still
powerful people

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.492
opposed to these works.

00:15:36.512 --> 00:15:40.329
Dedrick!

00:15:40.349 --> 00:15:43.532
Now please! Off you go!

00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:46.235
You to your writing and I to my
printing!

00:15:46.255 --> 00:15:48.804
Wer A sagt, muss auch sagen!

00:15:48.824 --> 00:15:50.572
You must finish what you start!

00:15:50.592 --> 00:15:53.809
God save you and good day, Herr
Quentel!

00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:54.910
Your pardon, sir.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.112
After you, please.

00:15:57.132 --> 00:15:59.314
Good afternoon, Herr Quentel!

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.083
Good afternoon, Herr Cochlaeus!

00:16:01.103 --> 00:16:03.643
I will be with you shortly...

00:16:09.978 --> 00:16:11.960
Hmmmm?

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:17.032
Ah! Hmmmm?

00:16:17.052 --> 00:16:18.829
Excuse me, sir!

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.674
And how is my work coming along?

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.142
It is done, Herr Cochlaeus!

00:16:27.162 --> 00:16:28.477
Wunderbol!

00:16:28.497 --> 00:16:30.446
Then this calls for a
celebration, does it not?

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:32.514
Will you join us Herr Quentel?

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:34.116
It is nearly your closing time!

00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:35.718
Not tonight, danke!

00:16:35.738 --> 00:16:38.353
I uh... have work to attend to.

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.856
But you go along and enjoy
yourselves!

00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:45.227
Then we shall drink to your
good work!

00:16:45.247 --> 00:16:48.697
...toast!

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.699
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.101
Ahhhh...

00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:54.503
ha ha ha...

00:16:54.523 --> 00:17:00.309
That is good beer! Gladdens the
heart!

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:02.511
And loosens the tongue...

00:17:02.531 --> 00:17:04.246
Now, then...tell me...

00:17:04.266 --> 00:17:07.916
About this mysterious book that
you are printing...

00:17:07.936 --> 00:17:13.047
(drunk) Ahhh... you mean... the
English Bible...

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.242
William! We are discovered!

00:17:33.262 --> 00:17:35.010
What? How?

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.045
Herr Cochlaeus, one of the
printer's clients-

00:17:37.065 --> 00:17:39.648
a very influential man with
strong ties to the Church...

00:17:39.668 --> 00:17:41.917
somehow he found out!

00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:44.353
The magistrates' soldier's are
at the print shop now.

00:17:44.373 --> 00:17:46.855
William, it's just a matter of
moments before they come here!

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:48.357
I've made arrangements for the
next ship!

00:17:48.377 --> 00:17:49.591
We must leave!

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:50.859
The Old Testament translations!

00:17:50.879 --> 00:17:53.487
Not one note must be left
behind!

00:18:04.593 --> 00:18:05.767
This way!

00:18:18.674 --> 00:18:20.389
A name printer!

00:18:20.409 --> 00:18:22.424
Give me his name!

00:18:22.444 --> 00:18:25.027
I...uh...am not sure... your
honor!

00:18:25.047 --> 00:18:28.597
You illegally print the
Scriptures in English

00:18:28.617 --> 00:18:31.233
for someone whose name you do
not recall?

00:18:31.253 --> 00:18:32.928
I...uh...

00:18:37.192 --> 00:18:40.776
Peter Quentel! You have lost
your business...

00:18:40.796 --> 00:18:45.914
will you also lose your life
and burn as a heretic?

00:18:45.934 --> 00:18:50.078
Give me...a name!

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.362
Quickly!

00:19:00.382 --> 00:19:01.522
Thank you!

00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:09.438
His name is William Tyndale.

00:19:09.458 --> 00:19:10.806
Aaauuuggghhh!

00:19:10.826 --> 00:19:15.110
Find Tyndale! Find that heretic!

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.637
Find William Tyndale!

00:19:24.806 --> 00:19:26.021
What now?

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:29.558
To a safer harbor, my friend...
...and to finish the work

00:19:29.578 --> 00:19:32.060
that God has set before us...
come what may.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.930
But for now... a good night's
rest!

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.023
I've had enough excitement for
one day.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.016
Gone!

00:19:54.036 --> 00:19:55.684
All the Old Testament
manuscripts...

00:19:55.704 --> 00:19:58.520
the translations... we've lost
it all.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.088
...but we are yet alive!

00:20:00.108 --> 00:20:02.357
The Lord will sustain us!

00:20:02.377 --> 00:20:07.886
The...Lord...will...
sustain...us!

00:20:16.825 --> 00:20:18.540
"The Obedience of the Christian
Man" -

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.009
a prohibited book!

00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:24.246
This is heresy and could very
well cost you your life!

00:20:24.266 --> 00:20:26.882
How did you come about this?

00:20:26.902 --> 00:20:29.918
I am the one to blame, your
Highness.

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:32.120
You, Lady Ann?

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.314
Whew!

00:20:37.646 --> 00:20:40.729
And what have you to do with a
book of this nature, my dear?

00:20:40.749 --> 00:20:43.031
Having heard so much about it,
my lord...

00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:46.969
I did my very best to obtain a
copy.

00:20:46.989 --> 00:20:48.870
My maid, who reads to me...

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.306
kept it in her possession...

00:20:51.326 --> 00:20:54.109
and in a spirit of playfulness
her acquaintance...

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.378
took it from her...

00:20:56.398 --> 00:20:59.548
only to be caught with it!

00:20:59.568 --> 00:21:02.818
Ahhh, so you truly are the
culprit.

00:21:02.838 --> 00:21:04.886
Indeed, my lord.

00:21:04.906 --> 00:21:08.523
Yet I found its reasoning quite
remarkable.

00:21:08.543 --> 00:21:10.625
For instance?

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.862
"God does not hold kings
subservient to the Church

00:21:13.882 --> 00:21:17.466
for they are a God-appointed
office in themselves."

00:21:17.486 --> 00:21:20.702
Ah... He has his wits about him!

00:21:20.722 --> 00:21:22.771
The Bishops are indeed a thorn
in our flesh

00:21:22.791 --> 00:21:25.807
and we could use a man that
isn't afraid to speak his mind,

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:30.445
this...William Tyndale!

00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:33.048
Then your highness must also
offer him pardon,

00:21:33.068 --> 00:21:35.250
for as his writings are
prohibited,

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.320
it is my understanding that he
lives a fugitive...

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.156
somewhere on the continent, I
believe.

00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:43.458
Then we shall offer him safe
conduct

00:21:43.478 --> 00:21:45.794
and a way to be of use to his
king.

00:21:45.814 --> 00:21:48.030
Bring him to me!

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:53.024
Come now... let us walk
together.

00:21:59.594 --> 00:22:01.410
So you finally found him.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.178
Yes your majesty.

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:05.380
I have found Master Tyndale.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.283
Or should I say, he found me?

00:22:08.303 --> 00:22:09.885
Oh?

00:22:09.905 --> 00:22:11.987
In Belgium your Majesty.

00:22:12.007 --> 00:22:13.989
I was led to him just outside
the city of Antwerp

00:22:14.009 --> 00:22:15.857
where he was waiting for me.

00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:17.959
I put forth your gracious offer
of safe conduct

00:22:17.979 --> 00:22:20.162
and to be part of your court.

00:22:20.182 --> 00:22:23.932
He, uh...was reluctant, your
grace.

00:22:23.952 --> 00:22:25.400
Reluctant?!

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.369
Thinking he feared for his life,

00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:30.972
I assured him of your kind
intention my Lord,

00:22:30.992 --> 00:22:34.509
and of the death of Cardinal
Thomas Wolsey...

00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:37.145
however, it seems I was mistaken

00:22:37.165 --> 00:22:40.148
to think he was concerned for
his own safety.

00:22:40.168 --> 00:22:43.185
He spoke of a continual
persecution of the reformers,

00:22:43.205 --> 00:22:46.855
and ahhh...He...

00:22:46.875 --> 00:22:49.688
he handed me a letter for your
Majesty.

00:22:54.382 --> 00:22:57.332
"If it would stand with the
king's most gracious pleasure

00:22:57.352 --> 00:22:59.668
"to grant that only a small
portion of scripture

00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:02.270
"may be distributed among his
people,

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.773
"whosoever's translation it may
be,

00:23:04.793 --> 00:23:07.576
"I will immediately make a
faithful promise

00:23:07.596 --> 00:23:11.313
"not to write more and to
return to England,

00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:15.450
"offering my body to suffer
whatever punishment necessary,

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.019
even death."

00:23:18.039 --> 00:23:21.957
He refuses our gracious
request...

00:23:21.977 --> 00:23:24.693
and gives us a condition to his
return?

00:23:24.713 --> 00:23:26.328
A condition?

00:23:26.348 --> 00:23:28.263
This troublemaker?

00:23:28.283 --> 00:23:30.098
To me?

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:35.537
If I allow the Scriptures to be
distributed then he will return!

00:23:35.557 --> 00:23:39.207
It is clear, your majesty that
you either , uh...

00:23:39.227 --> 00:23:43.478
submit to Tyndale and print his
...uh "scriptures" or,

00:23:43.498 --> 00:23:46.214
as he threatens, he will
continue to cause havoc

00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:48.817
among the people through his
writings.

00:23:48.837 --> 00:23:51.753
He threatens the Church and
now...

00:23:51.773 --> 00:23:54.356
it seems he dares to threaten
you!

00:23:54.376 --> 00:23:55.991
My Lord, I don't think he -

00:23:56.011 --> 00:23:58.160
He dares to threaten me?

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.128
Your Majesty...I don't -

00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:01.630
A threat indeed!

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.232
I want him found and arrested!

00:24:04.252 --> 00:24:07.002
Anyone, anyone in possession of
his writings

00:24:07.022 --> 00:24:10.961
will be hanged or burned...
without exception!

00:24:13.195 --> 00:24:15.210
As persecution mounted in
England,

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.045
William continued to write,

00:24:17.065 --> 00:24:21.750
encouraging sincere Christians
to stand firm for their faith.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.352
"Do not fear men that threaten
you

00:24:24.372 --> 00:24:28.924
"but trust God who is able to
make good on his promise.

00:24:28.944 --> 00:24:31.526
"Your cause is the Gospel,

00:24:31.546 --> 00:24:34.863
"a light that must be fed with
the blood of our testimony

00:24:34.883 --> 00:24:39.668
so that the light of the Gospel
will not go out."

00:24:39.688 --> 00:24:42.737
I will not have these writings
stir up confusion

00:24:42.757 --> 00:24:45.473
and discontent among the people.

00:24:45.493 --> 00:24:47.342
The man must be stopped.

00:24:47.362 --> 00:24:49.044
You will not return to this
place

00:24:49.064 --> 00:24:52.914
until you have found and
apprehended this open wound,

00:24:52.934 --> 00:24:57.686
William Tyndale.

00:24:57.706 --> 00:24:59.654
Your grace.

00:25:07.182 --> 00:25:09.264
The Poyntz family has been kind
enough to support me

00:25:09.284 --> 00:25:10.632
as I translate.

00:25:10.652 --> 00:25:12.801
They are truly a godsend and I
have no doubt

00:25:12.821 --> 00:25:14.826
they will welcome you to supper.

00:25:19.527 --> 00:25:23.111
William! Just in time for
supper!

00:25:23.131 --> 00:25:25.013
And a good one I might add.

00:25:25.033 --> 00:25:26.414
And I do hope you don't mind

00:25:26.434 --> 00:25:28.250
but I have brought along a new
friend.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.218
William, you must be careful.

00:25:30.238 --> 00:25:32.487
Not to worry, he's an honest
gentleman.

00:25:32.507 --> 00:25:34.122
Thomas Poyntz...

00:25:34.142 --> 00:25:35.757
Henry Phillips!

00:25:35.777 --> 00:25:39.124
It is truly a pleasure!

00:25:42.617 --> 00:25:43.932
...and so you see, Henry,

00:25:43.952 --> 00:25:45.800
just as the Apostle Paul
clearly expressed himself

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.136
to the early church in the
language of his day

00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:52.140
so we must have the scriptures
in the common language today,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.076
else how can the followers heed
the leader-

00:25:55.096 --> 00:25:57.679
I have learned much from you
William.

00:25:57.699 --> 00:25:59.180
And I from you.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.082
Ha - would that be true!

00:26:01.102 --> 00:26:05.487
In any case, it is time I repay
you, however humbly!

00:26:05.507 --> 00:26:06.788
Come!

00:26:06.808 --> 00:26:09.090
Join me for a meal and let us
talk more!

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.726
Ah! Two things I can never
decline!

00:26:11.746 --> 00:26:14.320
Wonderful... after you!

00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:20.135
... and further I might add
that Peter said,

00:26:20.155 --> 00:26:23.938
"As newly born babes, desire
the milk of the Word..."

00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:27.776
The Holy scriptures for babes,
for the unlearned -

00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:29.244
William Tyndale!

00:26:29.264 --> 00:26:31.713
What?

00:26:31.733 --> 00:26:35.583
Run Henry! Quickly, Henry. This
way!

00:26:35.603 --> 00:26:37.073
William!

00:26:43.311 --> 00:26:44.559
Which way? Which-

00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:47.562
William...William...

00:26:47.582 --> 00:26:49.998
William!

00:26:50.018 --> 00:26:53.501
William Tyndale! You are under
arrest.

00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:55.036
Oh!

00:26:55.056 --> 00:26:59.774
I shall have to have that
meal...all by myself.

00:26:59.794 --> 00:27:02.010
Wha-?

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.545
Henry?

00:27:03.565 --> 00:27:05.413
Farewell, William.

00:27:05.433 --> 00:27:12.787
It's been... shall we
say...captivating?

00:27:12.807 --> 00:27:15.557
William Tyndale you are under
arrest.

00:27:15.577 --> 00:27:18.660
I am commanded to take you
henceforth from this place

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.695
to Vivorde Castle.

00:27:20.715 --> 00:27:22.097
to Vivorde Castle.

00:27:22.117 --> 00:27:24.699
You stand accused of heresy-

00:27:24.719 --> 00:27:27.102
teaching what is against mother
church.

00:27:27.122 --> 00:27:29.104
I have neither written nor
taught anything

00:27:29.124 --> 00:27:31.039
contrary to the Holy Scriptures.

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:33.975
You break the laws of our
Church.

00:27:33.995 --> 00:27:39.481
Only when the Church breaks the
laws of God!

00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:44.185
So, you set yourself above the
authority of the Church?

00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:46.488
By God's grace, I am a servant
of the Church...

00:27:46.508 --> 00:27:48.857
insomuch as the Church serves
God.

00:27:48.877 --> 00:27:51.025
By your interpretation.

00:27:51.045 --> 00:27:54.358
By plain understanding of the
holy scriptures.

00:27:57.118 --> 00:27:59.434
Your writings are smuggled into
the hands

00:27:59.454 --> 00:28:01.169
of the common people-

00:28:01.189 --> 00:28:04.873
the Holy word of God in common
language.

00:28:04.893 --> 00:28:06.307
If the people seek the
Scriptures

00:28:06.327 --> 00:28:11.646
it is only because their soul
is hungry!

00:28:11.666 --> 00:28:16.851
Recant! Confess your fault!

00:28:16.871 --> 00:28:19.687
Renounce your writings-

00:28:19.707 --> 00:28:22.390
perhaps you shall be spared.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:26.928
I cannot but do as my
conscience dictates.

00:28:26.948 --> 00:28:29.130
Admit your guilt!

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.901
I cannot but do as my
conscience dictates!

00:28:32.921 --> 00:28:40.141
Then...you...shall...burn!

00:28:40.161 --> 00:28:44.245
Then...I...shall...burn!

00:28:44.265 --> 00:28:48.850
Burn! Burn! Burn!

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.354
William Tyndale you are charged
with heresy...

00:28:53.374 --> 00:28:56.858
in that you have translated and
distributed

00:28:56.878 --> 00:29:02.530
the Holy Scriptures in the
English language

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:08.937
which is in direct violation of
both state and Church.

00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:13.608
You have denied the authority
of the one true church...

00:29:13.628 --> 00:29:17.579
and are sentenced to be
executed...

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:20.582
by burning.

00:29:20.602 --> 00:29:25.952
May God have mercy on your soul!

00:29:58.506 --> 00:30:06.227
Lord... feed your sheep!

00:30:06.247 --> 00:30:12.767
Lord...open the King of
England's eyes!

00:30:12.787 --> 00:30:15.668
Open the King of England's eyes!

00:30:44.619 --> 00:30:47.569
William's death seemed like a
terrible defeat.

00:30:47.589 --> 00:30:49.037
But, within two years

00:30:49.057 --> 00:30:52.040
his dying prayer was
wonderfully answered.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.309
King Henry ordered that every
church in England

00:30:54.329 --> 00:30:58.246
make a copy of the English
Bible available for public
reading.

00:30:58.266 --> 00:30:59.447
Every church, father?

00:30:59.467 --> 00:31:00.748
Every church!

00:31:00.768 --> 00:31:03.918
You see, you and I can read
God's word now

00:31:03.938 --> 00:31:08.156
because of the sacrifice that
William and others made for us.

00:31:08.176 --> 00:31:09.257
Others like...

00:31:09.277 --> 00:31:11.125
Grandfather?

00:31:11.145 --> 00:31:14.629
Yes...Grandfather and other
brave people like them

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:16.864
who loved God's word!

00:31:16.884 --> 00:31:21.235
Grandfather taught me...
"Everyone who hears God's words

00:31:21.255 --> 00:31:24.172
and puts them into practice is
like a- "

00:31:24.192 --> 00:31:27.075
...Wise man who built his house
upon the rock!

00:31:27.095 --> 00:31:30.645
"The rain came down, the
streams rose,

00:31:30.665 --> 00:31:34.248
"and the winds blew and beat
against that house.

00:31:34.268 --> 00:31:36.050
"Yet, it did not fall

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:39.253
"because it had it's foundation
at the rock.

00:31:39.273 --> 00:31:41.522
"But, everyone who hears these
words of mine

00:31:41.542 --> 00:31:43.658
"and does not put them into
practice

00:31:43.678 --> 00:31:47.595
"is like the foolish man who
built his house on the sand.

00:31:47.615 --> 00:31:49.831
The rain came down..."

00:31:49.851 --> 00:31:53.801
"If God spare my life, I will
cause a ploughboy

00:31:53.821 --> 00:31:57.770
to know more scripture than the
average priest."
