1
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:59,706
By wireless from the BBC,

2
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,239
her Majesty, the Queen
of the Netherlands.

3
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,572
Fellow Hollanders,

4
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:09,006
the lights have gone out
over free Holland.

5
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:12,039
Where only two weeks ago

6
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,672
there was a free nation
of men and women

7
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:17,139
brought up in the cherished tradition

8
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,772
of Christian civilization,

9
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,772
there is now the stillness of death.

10
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:25,639
Oppressed...
Threatened...

11
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,239
Watched on every side

12
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:30,372
by a power that would tear out

13
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:33,273
all hope from the soul of man.

14
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,073
The unhappy people of Holland

15
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:38,739
can only pray in silence.

16
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:41,439
For those who have lost their voice

17
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,439
but not their hope or their vision

18
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,972
in the struggle against the
onslaught of barbarism.

19
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:53,339
Long live the Netherlands!

20
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:26,572
Oh! Coffee...

21
00:05:26,572 --> 00:05:29,706
In the parlor.

22
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:39,139
Achtung!
Achtung!

23
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,605
By order of the Reich's commissioner,

24
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:44,505
all citizens are ordered
to surrender their radios

25
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:47,972
and all other wireless equipment.

26
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:55,772
Achtung!
Achtung!

27
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,405
By order of the Reich's commissioner,

28
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:01,106
all citizens are ordered
to surrender their radios

29
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:04,239
and all other wireless equipment.

30
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:10,872
Good morning, Mr. Ten Boom.

31
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:14,073
I apologize for the intrusion.

32
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,405
They are collecting all radios.

33
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:18,206
I can see that.

34
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:20,772
Dutch policeman assisting them!

35
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:23,206
We do what we must.

36
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:26,906
All citizens are ordered
to surrender their radios

37
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:28,939
a radio, yes?

38
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,839
Upstairs...
In the parlor!

39
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,306
Get it.

40
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:40,505
You have many beautiful clocks here.

41
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:46,806
Bavarian?

42
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,872
The cabinet looks as if
it's a Berringer works.

43
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:52,772
Yeah, 1886.

44
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:56,405
You know watches...
Clocks?

45
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,772
My father is a watchmaker.

46
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:01,505
I grew up under his workbench.

47
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,439
And look what you've grown into.

48
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:09,006
What district?

49
00:07:09,006 --> 00:07:10,472
Mattenbraw.

50
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,605
Ah, Mattenbraw...

51
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:16,906
Mattenbraw, 1895.

52
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,073
Magnificent.

53
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:24,872
But you should have seen
that watch when it came in.

54
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:28,505
The way some people treat a watch--
No care...

55
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:31,039
No...
Understanding.

56
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,772
It was a gift on my 70th birthday.

57
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,872
"To grandpa Ten Boom from
the children of Haarlem.

58
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:44,039
26th of March, 1931."

59
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:47,906
Give him the horn.

60
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:51,839
Any other radios in the house?

61
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,405
No! None!

62
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,639
Good day, then.

63
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,505
I don't want anything too expensive.

64
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:55,106
Then there's this one.

65
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:58,106
Seven jewels in a Swiss factory

66
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:01,605
but all the craftsmen
are German immigrants!

67
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,073
It's 42 Guilders.

68
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:05,239
It's for an anniversary.

69
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,239
We could spend a little more.

70
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,139
Well, there's this one...

71
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,672
Bamendor works.

72
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:13,572
Excuse me.

73
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:16,906
Papa, are you going out?

74
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:20,806
I will not dodder around this house

75
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:22,539
and do nothing.

76
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,505
Papa?

77
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,206
Excuse me...

78
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:33,806
I'm sorry.

79
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,972
Ah, yes...

80
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:42,073
You see, you could have it engraved

81
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:46,372
or you could order it in ah, a white gold.

82
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:48,972
The white gold is 60.

83
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:51,339
...Residing in the occupied Netherlands

84
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,073
must come forward according
to the following regulations.

85
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,405
A person is considered being.

86
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:58,572
Take your star.

87
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,405
...A Jew or part Jew

88
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:02,239
next.

89
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,405
If he has at least one grandparent

90
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:06,572
who is originally a full Jew.

91
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,239
A grandparent is considered a Jew

92
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:13,372
if he belongs or has belonged
to the Jewish church.

93
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,639
You shouldn't be here.

94
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,939
I've come for my star.

95
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,372
They are for Jews.

96
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:27,839
You don't have a "J" on your identity card.

97
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,439
You could get it for me.

98
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:34,306
If we all wear them,
they wouldn't know

99
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:36,739
the difference between a gentile and a Jew.

100
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:39,839
Go home please...

101
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,372
Go home.

102
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:46,405
I will wear my star!

103
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:51,006
And I won't take it off until
God tells me to take it off!

104
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:53,639
The God of Abraham and Isaac

105
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,839
and my God, too!

106
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,505
Whose leader?

107
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:09,505
Hurry, quick.

108
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:10,672
Turn around!

109
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,906
Good morning...

110
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,972
Isn't it Miss Ten Boom?

111
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:19,273
Children, stop.

112
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:23,106
The watchmaker's shop?

113
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:26,039
Ten Boom, Berteljorisstraat!

114
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,106
Yah! You came for our radio.

115
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:32,572
I wrote to my father.

116
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:35,239
I told him about your shop.

117
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,839
Who are those boys?

118
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,939
Why are they being allowed
to torment that man?

119
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:42,306
They are young Dutch patriots.

120
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:44,639
He was heard to make public statements

121
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,006
derogatory to the Reich and our Fuhrer.

122
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,306
They are expressing their indignation.

123
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,339
Patriots?

124
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:56,273
Who are these children?

125
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:58,672
I teach a class.

126
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:01,605
I tell them about God.

127
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,372
At least, I used to.

128
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:07,306
This will be the last one.

129
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:09,706
Thanks to your new directive

130
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:11,539
concerning unauthorized meetings.

131
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:15,273
Miss Ten Boom...
The measures are temporary.

132
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:19,706
Once all this is over,
when order has been restored,

133
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,605
then all the Aryan peoples will live together

134
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:25,073
as brothers in our Reich.

135
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:27,505
Men live together as brothers

136
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:31,139
only in the kingdom of our Lord.

137
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,306
Nowhere else.

138
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:36,739
May we go?

139
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:42,106
Come...
Yeah.

140
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,605
Children...
Children...

141
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,439
Come! Come!

142
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:09,505
Some cookies.

143
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:12,073
Ah, yeah,
Jan comes running for the cookies.

144
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,439
Lisa, yeah.

145
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,405
Arnold...
Oh yeah!

146
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:21,306
Ha! Cookies?

147
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:23,505
Aha!

148
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:30,206
I...I may not be able to
be with you for a while.

149
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:31,572
Yes?

150
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:36,039
Ahh...
But Jesus will still be there...

151
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:39,405
Always watching over you.

152
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:46,572
You see...
Without Jesus,

153
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:49,239
we are like this...

154
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,372
Empty!

155
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,206
We can do nothing.

156
00:13:56,006 --> 00:14:03,106
But then Jesus fills us with His love.

157
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:10,073
Then we are full...
Yeah!

158
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:14,239
We can do anything...

159
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:17,239
We can do anything!

160
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,972
Nothing serious, pastor.

161
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:22,073
A little bit dirt maybe.

162
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:24,239
It's been losing 5 seconds a day.

163
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,139
Maybe a good cleaning

164
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,239
um-hum...
You can do it now?

165
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:33,872
While I'm here...
It really would be most helpful.

166
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,572
Yeah!

167
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:37,472
Good!

168
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:39,739
I'll go up and have a chat with your papa.

169
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:43,206
I hear he's been wearing a Jewish star.

170
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:47,605
Stubbornness is the child of pride

171
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:50,605
and pride is the first of
the seven deadly sins.

172
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:53,039
I'll speak to him about it.

173
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,339
Oh, I need to the back
at the church by 1:30.

174
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,972
It will be ready.

175
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,839
Dr. Heemstra!

176
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,772
Miss Ten Boom.

177
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:11,806
I can only stay for a moment.

178
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:22,806
Oh...
Oh!

179
00:15:30,173 --> 00:15:33,772
Oh, we need milk for him, not soup.

180
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:36,939
Good Lord,
you don't intend to keep it.

181
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,339
But you can't!!

182
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:45,039
It's illegal!

183
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,173
You could all be arrested.

184
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:51,339
He's beautiful.

185
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,639
Pastor...

186
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,139
The Lord must have sent you here.

187
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,972
You live in the country.

188
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:05,139
Nothing could be safer.

189
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:09,439
It's...
Impossible.

190
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,572
I-I...
Have my own family to think of.

191
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:17,939
We could lose everything for that child.

192
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:22,972
Where would my church be
w-without a Shepherd.

193
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,539
Oh, but...

194
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:26,472
No, Betsie!

195
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:29,106
The pastor has decided.

196
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:31,006
It is the law!

197
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:33,572
And Christians must obey the law!

198
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,772
Think what you are risking

199
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:41,239
for the sake of one Jewish baby.

200
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,906
Will you report us pastor,

201
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:47,073
if the baby must stay a while with us?

202
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:51,439
Corrie...
We are meant to obey the law of the state,

203
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:55,739
if it does not go against
a higher law of God.

204
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,106
Pastor, you want me to take off my star.

205
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,372
Very well, I will not wear it.

206
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,806
And we will keep the child!

207
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:16,739
As a Christian...

208
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:19,872
I am sorry that any man must suffer

209
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,439
no matter who he is...

210
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,039
Or what his race.

211
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,572
But remember, it is the Jews.

212
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,906
Who gave us the Bible.

213
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:32,706
And our Savior!

214
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,972
It is on your heads.

215
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:49,772
I'll pick up my watch tomorrow.

216
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,006
Good day, Ten Boom.

217
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,906
Ladies.

218
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,872
God forgive him.

219
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,572
He did not mean it.

220
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:05,173
How can that man call
himself a Christian?

221
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:08,839
If a mouse lives in the cookie jar,

222
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,139
that doesn't necessarily
make him a cookie.

223
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:16,505
What will we do?

224
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:18,405
We must have milk.

225
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:20,339
He should go to the country.

226
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,339
Careful, he'll suffocate.

227
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:24,339
Where will you send him?

228
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:25,872
God will know.

229
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,639
Doors are opening all over Holland.

230
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,572
Last week we had a Dutch farm girl

231
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:31,872
and a Prussian Baroness
in the same bed.

232
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:37,706
And now you'll have a
little Moses in the basket.

233
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,672
Corrie, please.

234
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:48,405
Thank you.

235
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,639
Willem!

236
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,639
He must not cry!

237
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:57,206
You certainly are organized.

238
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:59,306
Oh, it's not the first time.

239
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,539
We are a way station...

240
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:07,139
For a day or for a week.

241
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:10,206
You've kept this from us, Willem?

242
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:13,439
German Jews before the
occupation and now the Dutch.

243
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,605
We do what we can

244
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,039
but the Nazis will not be satisfied

245
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,273
until there's not a Jew left in Europe.

246
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:25,073
They have touched the apple of God's eye.

247
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:26,405
I pity them!

248
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:27,605
I hate them.

249
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:28,939
Oh, Corrie...

250
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:31,505
You can't hate anyone
and walk with the Lord.

251
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,339
You could have told us,
Willem, we might have helped.

252
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:39,339
The important thing is to get
our little friend out of here.

253
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,306
You'd be hard pressed to explain
a sudden gift from heaven.

254
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,405
Son, I'll walk with you a little way.

255
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,672
Goodbye, Moses.

256
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,706
We've been managing all right

257
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:50,872
some potatoes...

258
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:53,273
And occasionally eggs, even!

259
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:55,706
So far we haven't done too badly.

260
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,539
And of course we...

261
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:02,672
Is this the Dutch farm girl?

262
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:04,672
Grandpa!

263
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:06,672
Kik, did you get anything?

264
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,639
The carbon from the wastebasket--

265
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:11,505
if you hold it up to the light,
you can just make it out.

266
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:12,806
Thank you.

267
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,672
You see, papa,

268
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,106
we have a contact in the Gestapo office.

269
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,839
Hush!!

270
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:25,772
He gives us the deportation
lists whenever he can.

271
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:28,239
All right, Kik!

272
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,239
Uh-huh.

273
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:32,839
Good-bye, grandpa.

274
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,539
God bless you, Kik.

275
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,672
Steady it with one hand...
Good!

276
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,273
Papa...

277
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,906
Every day now...

278
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:51,405
They send 400 Jews from
Amsterdam Central Station.

279
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:54,972
We reach those we can.

280
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:59,206
Do we know anyone on the list?

281
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,672
Gewassen!

282
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:25,306
Steinweinen!

283
00:21:34,806 --> 00:21:37,872
Schloss! Schloss!

284
00:21:52,106 --> 00:21:55,306
Schloss! Schloss!

285
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,972
I beg your pardon.

286
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:17,006
No, please,

287
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:19,439
I...
I'm sorry...

288
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,539
To...
To inconvenience you.

289
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,273
Maybe he's a...

290
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,006
Papa...

291
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:52,173
There's a gentleman upstairs.

292
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:54,039
We have met.

293
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,806
Well, it was so late...

294
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:57,139
He had no place to go

295
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:58,472
papa, he's a professor.

296
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:00,106
Willem studied with him.

297
00:23:00,106 --> 00:23:01,772
They've closed the university.

298
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:03,472
All the Jewish teachers were forced...

299
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:05,306
Ah, Betsie...

300
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:10,173
Good morning again, professor.

301
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:14,539
I apologize for the
intrusion Mr Ten Boom.

302
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,006
Please...

303
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,405
Thank you.

304
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:28,872
Professor...

305
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:32,672
Will you do us the honor
of asking the blessing?

306
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:45,906
Blessed art thou, oh Lord, our God,

307
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:49,706
who bringest forth bread from the earth.

308
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:51,706
Amen.

309
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:53,672
Amen.

310
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:06,339
Ah! How fortunate aunt bep had big feet.

311
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:07,872
Yes.

312
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:09,372
Hm...

313
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:10,672
Oh...

314
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:12,405
Now, when were you born?

315
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:14,073
Born?

316
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:15,139
Ummm.

317
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:16,405
Oh...

318
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:23,073
Ah, 19th August, 1885.

319
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:25,339
Father's name?

320
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,972
Ten Boom, Casper.

321
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:29,372
Mother?

322
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:32,572
Ten Boom, Cornelia.

323
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:35,006
Her maiden name?

324
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,439
Miss Ten Boom,

325
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,939
if we are stopped, I...

326
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:42,972
I could never pass as you.

327
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:45,539
Professor Ziener...

328
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,639
There are no "ifs" in God's world.

329
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:51,039
Now, he brought you to this house,

330
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,273
and he will see you get safely away.

331
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:58,672
This is where we turn, professor.

332
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:00,806
Stay close with me.

333
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:02,439
I'll try.

334
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:43,173
It's wonderful professor!
We're almost there.

335
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:49,206
Katrien.

336
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:51,739
Aunt Corrie!

337
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:55,139
Aunt Corrie. Katrien,

338
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:58,073
I need your father's help.

339
00:25:58,073 --> 00:26:01,139
You should have seen professor
Ziener getting into the boat.

340
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,772
Katrien's father attending
him like he was

341
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,872
Queen Wilhelmina boarding the yacht!

342
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:10,006
Cornelia, do you think we are
enjoying this a little too much?

343
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:11,772
Enjoying?

344
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:14,073
No, I was terrified.

345
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,772
If I hadn't been able to laugh at him

346
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:18,872
all dressed up like Betsie

347
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:20,839
Oh! Thank God.

348
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,872
He kept the patrols away.

349
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,372
Be sure to save a piece of
cake for Willem's friend.

350
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:27,672
Friend?

351
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:29,605
It's all very mysterious.

352
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:31,972
Someone he wants us to meet.

353
00:26:31,972 --> 00:26:35,739
What did Willem say when you
told him about professor Ziener?

354
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:40,006
This is not some game you
play when the mood strikes.

355
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:43,239
If you become involved in this work,

356
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:46,839
people will be forced to trust you...

357
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,772
With their lives!

358
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:50,505
I told you, Willem.

359
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:52,806
We gave him my papers.

360
00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:56,206
We thought it out very carefully.

361
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:58,306
And if they questioned him...

362
00:26:58,306 --> 00:27:00,572
Was he supposed to sing soprano?

363
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:06,239
No...He was going to have...
Quincy throat.

364
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,672
Excuse me.

365
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,939
You wander along the canal

366
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,739
picking someone out of thin air

367
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:17,839
how did you know you could trust him?

368
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,806
I knew the man.

369
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,372
And I knew what the Lord had told me.

370
00:27:22,372 --> 00:27:24,106
Papa...

371
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:26,672
You are the master of this house.

372
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:31,173
The master of this house...

373
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:34,505
Commands that we open the door

374
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:37,073
to anyone who knocks.

375
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,605
We cannot afford to ignore anyone

376
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:45,939
who seriously engages in our
work, whatever their methods.

377
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:52,039
Perhaps you will allow us to...
assist your efforts.

378
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:34,439
Thank you for the delivery, Mr. Smit.

379
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:41,772
Only for emergencies!

380
00:28:41,772 --> 00:28:45,006
We have a contact at the exchange,

381
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:48,572
but you can never be certain
that the line is not tapped.

382
00:28:48,572 --> 00:28:51,505
But you will be expected to
develop your own sources.

383
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:54,772
The less contact you have with me,

384
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:58,073
or with anyone else...
the better.

385
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:02,339
Willem, we know half of Haarlem.

386
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:05,472
We have friends everywhere!

387
00:29:05,472 --> 00:29:08,772
Dear lady,
knowing them is one thing...

388
00:29:08,772 --> 00:29:11,505
Knowing their political views...

389
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,339
God knows!

390
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:16,505
And we will ask him to lead.

391
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,206
Oh, we appreciate your concern,
Mr. Sluring.

392
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:25,539
We are not the most likely candidates.

393
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,405
But since there is a need.

394
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:31,339
We must do what we can to meet it.

395
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:34,006
People have every kind of reason

396
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,639
for wanting to work in the underground

397
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:38,672
excitement, perhaps.

398
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:43,339
Mr. Sluring,

399
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:46,739
we are past the age when excitement is

400
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:49,939
of any major concern in our lives.

401
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:55,605
Truthfully...
I'd rather do anything else.

402
00:29:55,605 --> 00:30:00,139
I'd like to close the door
and never open it again

403
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:03,939
until this whole hideous thing is over.

404
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:06,405
But, that's me.

405
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:10,706
My Lord Jesus tells me

406
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:13,472
to open the door to whatever comes.

407
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:18,706
To give his love in whatever way I can.

408
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:22,806
And I will listen to his voice...

409
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:25,839
Not mine.

410
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,106
Do we pass inspection?

411
00:30:33,872 --> 00:30:36,173
How many can you take?

412
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:40,273
There's ah, mama's room

413
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:42,206
and there's your old room,

414
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:45,039
and there's aunt Anna's room

415
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,739
and auntie Bep's room,

416
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,672
and our 3 rooms--
that's 7.

417
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:51,372
And we can share a bed if we have to.

418
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:54,806
So! Our hotel is ready for guests.

419
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:56,872
Not quite.

420
00:30:56,872 --> 00:31:00,106
What do you do if the Gestapo comes?

421
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:07,139
You will have a visitor,
a Jan Smit.

422
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:10,339
Actually, it's two houses.

423
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,872
Over a hundred years ago
they were joined together.

424
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,839
The one in the front is 2 rooms deep

425
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,872
and one room wide.

426
00:31:17,872 --> 00:31:22,039
The one at the back,
here, is 3 rooms:

427
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,206
One on top of the other.

428
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:27,106
Papa!

429
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:28,539
This is Mr. Smit.

430
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:30,405
Mr. Smit.

431
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:32,539
I know some Smits in Amsterdam.

432
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,472
Are you with the Smit family
that makes the candy?

433
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:37,639
Father, this is the man
that I told you about.

434
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:39,839
He's come to inspect the house.

435
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,806
Oh! A building inspector?

436
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:45,972
Do you have the offices
on Grote Hous Street?

437
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,605
No, papa.

438
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,472
He is not a building inspector,
and his name is not Smit.

439
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:52,273
Not Smit?

440
00:31:52,273 --> 00:31:53,806
Excuse us, papa.

441
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:56,006
We must look at the rest of the house.

442
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:02,605
The parlor...

443
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:12,006
Mealtimes--
that's a favorite hour for a raid.

444
00:32:13,906 --> 00:32:16,206
Watch your wastebaskets...

445
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:19,073
and ashtrays.

446
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:24,906
We need to be as high as possible.

447
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:28,206
It allows for the best
chance to reach a safe place

448
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:30,206
while they search below.

449
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:35,405
These are all bedrooms?

450
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:36,872
Yeah.

451
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,139
If a raid comes at night,

452
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:42,306
they'll have to take their bedding,

453
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:45,273
but make certain the mattress gets turned.

454
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:47,772
A favorite trick of the Gestapo

455
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:49,872
feeling for a warm spot on the bed.

456
00:32:49,872 --> 00:32:52,073
What's up there?

457
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:04,273
Ah-ha!

458
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,339
The roof is directly above.

459
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:08,339
Who sleeps here?

460
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:10,006
I do.

461
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:12,539
Perfect!!

462
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:23,273
The wall...
Will go... Here!

463
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:39,872
All clear! The sign's in the window.

464
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,572
You see, there is a distinctive marking--

465
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:54,139
you can always tell Flenstadht work.

466
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,039
Peter!

467
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,672
Lovely day, aunt Betsie.

468
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,806
Peter! No, no.

469
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:11,206
I'll come for it Tuesday then.

470
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:12,806
Good.

471
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:17,306
Ah! Herr Ten Boom!

472
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:21,906
Friessian!

473
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:25,405
Such beautiful wood!

474
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:28,906
My father made a case like this once.

475
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:33,706
Oh, he spent months building it,
polishing... oiling.

476
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:37,239
It ah...
Is just a shell...

477
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,972
It needs a complete set of works.

478
00:34:39,972 --> 00:34:43,239
What price will you be asking?

479
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:50,405
Well, it will take some
months to be ready.

480
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:53,372
Name a good price.

481
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:56,505
Exorbitant, even,
I'll pay.

482
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:01,772
I like the clock.

483
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:04,306
I can afford the best!

484
00:35:04,306 --> 00:35:07,505
But it, it has no works.

485
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,372
None.

486
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:12,872
Very well.

487
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:17,706
Tuesday, Herr Ten Boom.

488
00:35:25,672 --> 00:35:27,972
Kik! Hurry!

489
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:34,672
Aunt Betsie,
how many times do you have to be told

490
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:37,372
take the sign out of the window

491
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:39,073
when it isn't safe!!

492
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:42,439
Oh, Kik, I'm sorry.

493
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:45,539
I'm sorry!!

494
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:46,706
Grandpa...

495
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:48,439
Look!

496
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:01,972
Tea, Mr. Smit?

497
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,839
Oh! Danke!

498
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:19,806
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

499
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:20,972
Good morning.

500
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,972
Milk! Where did you get...

501
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,006
Not milk...
Paint!

502
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:26,706
Paint?

503
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:29,106
Betsie!
Oh, Betsie.

504
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:32,505
Do you remember Fred Koonstra?

505
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:34,505
Of course...

506
00:36:34,505 --> 00:36:37,139
He read our electric meter for years.

507
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,139
His daughter was in our Bible class.

508
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,239
Yeah!...
Milk!!!

509
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,472
Paint.

510
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:46,639
Paint! Elsie Koonstra.

511
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,872
I know her name.

512
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:51,772
I just had to sort out a few faces.

513
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:54,706
She must be in her twenties by now.

514
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:58,639
I heard yesterday that Fred Koonstra
works at the food office.

515
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,605
Where?

516
00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:03,572
They issue ration cards.

517
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:17,806
I will be frank.

518
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:20,539
We've had some unexpected company.

519
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:25,306
First, a baby...
Then a man...

520
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:28,339
And now last night, a couple.

521
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:32,405
All Jews, Mr. Koonstra.

522
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:35,572
Why do you tell me?

523
00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:40,839
There are only three of
us left at home now--

524
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:43,972
my father, my sister, and me,

525
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:47,439
and our ration cards are just not enough.

526
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,273
All ration cards are checked.

527
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:52,906
Accounted for in a dozen different ways.

528
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:57,472
Yeah! Yeah! I...
I know.

529
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,505
I...

530
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:02,505
I should not have asked you.

531
00:38:04,872 --> 00:38:09,605
I thought perhaps you could advise me.

532
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:12,505
The food office at Utrecht
was robbed last week.

533
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:15,206
The men were caught

534
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:17,139
...and shot.

535
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,806
If it happened at noon,

536
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:25,339
when just the record clerk
and I were there...

537
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,505
We'd have to be tied and gagged.

538
00:38:33,372 --> 00:38:35,806
How many cards do you need?

539
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:39,339
A hundred!

540
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:43,039
I know someone who might do it.

541
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,239
Papa! Now!!

542
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,306
Papa!

543
00:39:23,872 --> 00:39:25,872
Done.

544
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:27,372
How long?

545
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:28,872
47 seconds!

546
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:31,806
They better not send us
anyone wider than me.

547
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,306
Hallelujah!

548
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:39,839
Our Lord, we ask your blessing
on this hiding place.

549
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:44,006
You eat what you like!

550
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,572
Herren, it is not Kosher.

551
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:48,439
It's not important.

552
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:50,339
Would you pass the potatoes, please?

553
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,572
Go, go! Go!

554
00:39:58,906 --> 00:40:00,872
Hurry, hurry.

555
00:40:00,872 --> 00:40:03,405
...One at the head, one at the foot,

556
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:05,039
one on each side.

557
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,806
You're spilling it!

558
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:37,605
One minute and 15 seconds.

559
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:40,505
Ah! It's long enough

560
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,372
to curdle the stomach.

561
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:02,872
Peace be with this house
and all that dwell within it.

562
00:41:02,872 --> 00:41:04,539
The peace of the Lord God...

563
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:06,039
Get inside!

564
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,039
You stand outside and pray.

565
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,039
I was told you had accommodations.

566
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,039
I will require a room to myself

567
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,106
quiet for study, preferably
with no children.

568
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,772
Well, can you take me in?

569
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:19,605
Well, yes...
Good.

570
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:22,439
...I suppose so, but there
are many questions that I...

571
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,439
I would like something to eat.

572
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:30,839
The last meal was yesterday--
thank you-- at noon.

573
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:35,306
This is a Kosher house?

574
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:37,306
Well, we try.

575
00:41:37,306 --> 00:41:39,672
We have many requests that
we're not able to fill.

576
00:41:39,672 --> 00:41:41,505
There are no children?

577
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:44,273
Well, not at present,

578
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:46,839
but they come and they go.

579
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,505
Let them stay gone while I am here.

580
00:41:49,505 --> 00:41:51,505
This the way?

581
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:54,073
Yeah! But I would first like
to talk to you about...

582
00:41:54,073 --> 00:41:56,906
My contacts have told me that
most of your quests are transient

583
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:59,539
they are on their way out of the country.

584
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:01,173
Most of them, yes.

585
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:02,972
Well, I will not be.

586
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:06,872
I'm a teacher and chief cantor for
the congregation Beth Kodesh.

587
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:10,039
I will not be driven away by
these grinning Siegfreids

588
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:12,206
and their thousand-year Reich.

589
00:42:12,206 --> 00:42:16,505
Who is this man?...
A partriarch like Isaac

590
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:18,572
or Jacob, father of nations.

591
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,239
Papa, we have a new guest.

592
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,106
This is my father, Mr. Ten Boom.

593
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:25,306
Papa, this is Mr...

594
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:27,439
Wijnstok, Meyer Wijnstok.

595
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:29,439
Pleased to meet you Ten Boom.

596
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:32,439
God willing and the
accommodations proving suitable,

597
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:36,439
I will be staying with you
until this nonsense is over.

598
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,106
You are welcome.

599
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:39,206
Thank you.

600
00:42:39,206 --> 00:42:41,273
Miss Ten Boom, my room please.

601
00:42:57,472 --> 00:42:59,772
Aunt Betsie!

602
00:42:59,772 --> 00:43:01,006
Ohh!!

603
00:43:01,006 --> 00:43:03,173
My friend Jan needs a
place to stay for awhile.

604
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:04,806
Oh!

605
00:43:04,806 --> 00:43:06,806
He got away from the transport.

606
00:43:06,806 --> 00:43:09,306
By noon tomorrow he will
have new identity papers.

607
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:10,872
But...

608
00:43:10,872 --> 00:43:13,306
Where did you get the uniforms?

609
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:15,806
Not all Germans are Nazis, aunt Betsie.

610
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:18,039
Is it Jan?

611
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:24,106
Corrie! Mr. Wijnstok refused
kitchen duty again.

612
00:43:24,106 --> 00:43:26,572
He has to study.

613
00:43:26,572 --> 00:43:29,739
He wants to eat, he's got to
do his share of the work.

614
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,972
Where is he now?

615
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:33,772
In the parlor.

616
00:43:33,772 --> 00:43:35,972
Oh can I have...
Oh, excuse me.

617
00:43:35,972 --> 00:43:37,772
It's all right.

618
00:43:37,772 --> 00:43:40,572
Corrie, he's already been upset today.

619
00:43:40,572 --> 00:43:44,139
He found out we call him
"Eusie" behind his back.

620
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:46,872
Maybe it's his great dignity.

621
00:43:46,872 --> 00:43:49,906
He should be flattered he
reminds us of a scholar!

622
00:43:49,906 --> 00:43:51,939
But a gentile scholar.

623
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:54,906
He said, "We should have at
least called him Josephus."

624
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:56,772
Rules are rules!

625
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:03,372
Mr. Wijnstok, my sister tells
me that you have refused...

626
00:44:03,372 --> 00:44:06,173
Miss Ten Boom, I am praying.

627
00:44:09,972 --> 00:44:12,472
First you refused to work on Saturday,

628
00:44:12,472 --> 00:44:14,273
because that was the Sabbath.

629
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:16,073
Then you refused to work on Sunday

630
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,739
because that was our day of rest.

631
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,739
I was simply trying to pay respect

632
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,306
to the practice of this house.

633
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:24,273
But today is Tuesday.

634
00:44:24,273 --> 00:44:26,173
Tell me, Miss Ten Boom,

635
00:44:26,173 --> 00:44:28,706
why you have found it necessary
to give me a nickname?

636
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:31,173
We have called you Eusie simply because...

637
00:44:31,173 --> 00:44:34,006
Eusie is the kind of a name
you would give to a pet cat.

638
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:38,472
As a guest in your house,
am I no longer entitled to respect?

639
00:44:38,472 --> 00:44:41,539
We are getting completely off the subject.

640
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:44,739
However, as it seems to
give you both satisfaction,

641
00:44:44,739 --> 00:44:48,139
please have the courage to
use the name to my face.

642
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:51,306
If you want Eusie,
Eusie it will be.

643
00:44:51,306 --> 00:44:52,772
Ladies!

644
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:01,139
Get up!

645
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:06,405
Ah, good morning!

646
00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:07,906
Good morning!

647
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:11,472
Good morning!

648
00:45:11,472 --> 00:45:12,605
Morning.

649
00:45:12,605 --> 00:45:14,139
It's after seven.

650
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:16,639
Can't you smell breakfast?

651
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:18,472
Yeah!

652
00:45:22,706 --> 00:45:25,605
Betsie!
Betsie...

653
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:27,339
Oh, good morning!

654
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:28,872
What is it?

655
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:30,572
Today is the 18th!

656
00:45:30,572 --> 00:45:33,239
It's mama and papa's anniversary!

657
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:34,806
Oh, no.

658
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:38,405
54 coupons for cream puffs.

659
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:42,439
Tell Mr. Klassen it's for papa.

660
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:45,939
Corrie...

661
00:45:50,073 --> 00:45:53,239
Corrie...
That blouse and that skirt...

662
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:55,239
You just can't.

663
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:56,706
Not today.

664
00:45:56,706 --> 00:45:57,906
But...

665
00:45:57,906 --> 00:46:00,739
You'd look like a flag on a mudboat.

666
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:02,806
But you always liked this blouse.

667
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:05,206
The blouse is beautiful
and you are beautiful,

668
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:07,572
but the combination of you,

669
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:11,706
the blouse, and the skirt is impossible.

670
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,472
Huh.

671
00:46:21,306 --> 00:46:24,806
♪San-ta Lu-ci-a ♪

672
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:30,605
♪ Santa... Luci...a ♪

673
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:41,672
Papa Ten Boom,
you are a most singular man.

674
00:46:41,672 --> 00:46:44,639
For such a great man,

675
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,772
there must have been a great woman.

676
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:54,372
Now this is not exactly a song,

677
00:46:54,372 --> 00:46:58,073
it's more a...
Um, a blessing.

678
00:46:58,073 --> 00:47:02,106
It's, ah...
It means "May God bless you,

679
00:47:02,106 --> 00:47:05,505
may he protect you,

680
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:11,872
and may his face shine upon you."

681
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:42,939
Do you want the whole
of Haarlem to hear you?

682
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:46,639
I did not ask to be born a Jew.

683
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:49,572
I am sick of being expected to

684
00:47:49,572 --> 00:47:52,806
bear the burden of suffering
for the entire world

685
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:57,173
because my mother's name was
...Stein.

686
00:47:57,173 --> 00:48:00,972
So, you will be another Esau,

687
00:48:00,972 --> 00:48:06,306
selling your birthright
for a mess of porridge!!

688
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:09,306
I don't want your great Judaic heritage!

689
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:12,939
I don't want any part of
your Lord God Jehovah.

690
00:48:14,273 --> 00:48:17,273
It is no easy thing

691
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:21,306
to stand in the palm of God's hand.

692
00:48:29,972 --> 00:48:32,106
Betsie, go get the door.

693
00:48:32,106 --> 00:48:34,106
Betsie, go!!

694
00:48:34,106 --> 00:48:36,306
Yes, yes I go.

695
00:48:41,939 --> 00:48:44,339
Oh...
Um...

696
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,339
Yes, in a moment!!

697
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:48,672
It's Mrs. Beukers.

698
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:49,906
Oh!!

699
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:52,672
Betsie, are you crazy?

700
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:55,605
The whole street can
hear your Jews singing.

701
00:48:55,605 --> 00:48:57,472
Thank you.

702
00:48:59,405 --> 00:49:02,073
Tonight on the overseas service of the BBC,

703
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:05,806
we have special greetings and love to 2017,

704
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:07,972
...Private Sidney Harris from his mother.

705
00:49:07,972 --> 00:49:10,306
And to 1433,
Lance corporal Phillip Munen

706
00:49:10,306 --> 00:49:12,306
from his wife, Doris.

707
00:49:12,306 --> 00:49:13,972
Double three.

708
00:49:13,972 --> 00:49:16,972
Has anyone seen or heard of Alan Stokes
who was last heard of in Bournmouth?

709
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:19,806
His father is in the hospital
in London and dangerously ill.

710
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:22,706
Will Alan Stokes please contact
guys hospital Whitehall 9527.

711
00:49:22,706 --> 00:49:24,505
9527.

712
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:26,505
That number again is Whitehall 9527.

713
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,539
2-7.

714
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:28,706
2-7.

715
00:49:28,706 --> 00:49:30,639
The next program is music played by...

716
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,539
How can I ever remember them?

717
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:37,806
The way we used to pass
messages in church.

718
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:08,639
Kik.

719
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,906
Aunt Corrie.

720
00:50:11,472 --> 00:50:14,372
All these numbers...
What do they mean?

721
00:50:14,372 --> 00:50:16,772
Oh, different things,
instructions mostly.

722
00:50:16,772 --> 00:50:19,006
Instructions for what?

723
00:50:19,006 --> 00:50:21,372
Well, there could be a
pilot down somewhere.

724
00:50:21,372 --> 00:50:24,273
The numbers could be coordinates
for picking him up...

725
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:27,239
Or maybe for blowing up
a Nazi supply train!

726
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,539
Things like that.

727
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:31,639
Sabotage?

728
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:35,339
We could have blood on our hands.

729
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:43,772
For Holland.

730
00:50:43,772 --> 00:50:45,839
Does that make it right?

731
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,039
Lying, stealing, killing?

732
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,539
Whatever helps Holland is right.

733
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:56,739
I need the message aunt Corrie,
they're waiting.

734
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,206
What will we be like when this is over?

735
00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:17,372
Miss Ten Boom?

736
00:52:17,372 --> 00:52:18,972
Yeah!

737
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,405
Thank you for being so prompt.

738
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:29,806
I have heard a great deal about you...

739
00:52:29,806 --> 00:52:31,806
About your work.

740
00:52:31,806 --> 00:52:33,872
I'm afraid it's my father's work.

741
00:52:33,872 --> 00:52:35,572
Not the watchmaking.

742
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:44,306
Your other work.

743
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:47,505
You mean with the children?

744
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:50,139
We've had to disband the class.

745
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:52,039
Miss Ten Boom,

746
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:54,572
many of us who are in no position
to publicize our feelings,

747
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:57,939
are in great sympathy
with what you're doing.

748
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:06,772
People call your house
"God's underground."

749
00:53:10,972 --> 00:53:13,672
Are you trying to trap me, sir?

750
00:53:13,672 --> 00:53:17,505
Using the name of the
Lord is not the way.

751
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:19,839
If it were a trap,

752
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,372
you would be down the hall
talking with the Gestapo.

753
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:25,206
This will go no further.

754
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:28,139
Then why did you send for me?

755
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:33,605
I want you...

756
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:37,372
To pass this man's name

757
00:53:37,372 --> 00:53:39,906
on to your friends.

758
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:46,239
Who is he?

759
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:50,206
A businessman.

760
00:53:50,206 --> 00:53:53,605
He betrays people to the Gestapo.

761
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:57,939
The going rate is 75 Guilders a head.

762
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:03,306
Just pass it along...

763
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:06,106
They'll take care of him.

764
00:54:10,806 --> 00:54:15,405
If I could do what you ask,

765
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:19,039
it would be the same
as killing him myself.

766
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,039
I can only put him in
the hands of the Lord,

767
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,839
and ask the Lord to reach his heart.

768
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:42,539
You do that, Miss Ten Boom.

769
00:55:00,472 --> 00:55:03,173
The demons are out tonight.

770
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:11,939
I would assume you could
sleep through anything.

771
00:55:15,906 --> 00:55:18,539
Some tea?

772
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:21,605
Thank you.

773
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:34,706
You know, Miss Ten Boom,

774
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,339
you and I are very much alike.

775
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:42,572
Stubborn...Tough... Determined.

776
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:46,539
You still don't do your share of the work.

777
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:50,039
We are the same, yes.

778
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:52,706
But I am more so...

779
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:55,173
So...
I win!

780
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:02,239
Did you know that...

781
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,372
I have a wife and small son?

782
00:56:06,372 --> 00:56:12,605
Precisely--
I do not choose to expose myself.

783
00:56:12,605 --> 00:56:16,039
They got away.

784
00:56:19,972 --> 00:56:23,006
At least I...
Think they did.

785
00:56:24,872 --> 00:56:28,306
I will not go around like the others,

786
00:56:28,306 --> 00:56:32,972
begging for sympathy and reassurance.

787
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:37,173
We know so little about each other.

788
00:56:37,173 --> 00:56:41,039
You busy yourself with our needs.

789
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:44,505
Surely you have some needs of your own.

790
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:49,806
It's people like us,
Miss Ten Boom...

791
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:54,505
Raging torrents behind the stubborn jaw.

792
00:56:56,906 --> 00:56:59,106
No torrents.

793
00:57:01,173 --> 00:57:05,472
You might say my life has been...
Boring.

794
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:07,405
Until all this?

795
00:57:07,405 --> 00:57:10,339
Until all this.

796
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:15,706
Was marriage never considered
for the daughters Ten Boom?

797
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:19,806
Betsie was always unwell.

798
00:57:19,806 --> 00:57:23,372
She was told she could
not bear children,

799
00:57:23,372 --> 00:57:26,206
so she chose not to marry.

800
00:57:27,306 --> 00:57:29,306
And you?

801
00:57:32,605 --> 00:57:35,405
I had a young man,

802
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:43,639
But I was not cut from fine
enough cloth for his family.

803
00:57:45,273 --> 00:57:47,605
I lacked grace.

804
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:52,239
Still...

805
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:54,505
I was the first woman

806
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:57,505
to be licensed a
watchmaker in Holland.

807
00:58:02,906 --> 00:58:06,439
And you have your father,

808
00:58:06,439 --> 00:58:11,306
and you have your religion.

809
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:15,405
Is it enough?

810
00:58:15,405 --> 00:58:17,639
More than enough.

811
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:20,939
God has been good to me.

812
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:25,405
Yes, I...
I think he has.

813
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:34,372
And I think I shall be
going back to my bed.

814
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:39,372
I will pray for your family.

815
00:58:43,906 --> 00:58:48,173
Don't think you will get me to
peel potatoes, Miss Ten Boom.

816
00:59:12,472 --> 00:59:14,372
Good morning.

817
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:16,206
Miss Ten Boom?

818
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:18,472
Yeah?

819
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,439
My name is Vogel...
Jan Vogel.

820
00:59:21,439 --> 00:59:24,839
I came all the way from Ermelo.

821
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:35,239
Do you have a watch that needs repair?

822
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:40,039
I need 600 Guilders.

823
00:59:41,806 --> 00:59:44,405
I've heard you have certain contacts.

824
00:59:48,173 --> 00:59:50,972
I don't understand.

825
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:54,073
It's my wife...

826
00:59:56,539 --> 00:59:59,206
She's been arrested.

827
00:59:59,206 --> 01:00:01,572
She's Jewish.

828
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:07,173
That's a lot of money.

829
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:13,339
There's a policeman who'll arrange
everything for 600 Guilders...

830
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:17,405
And then she'll need a place to hide.

831
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:27,273
What now?

832
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:34,806
Somebody's calling for this within the hour.

833
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:37,806
A Mr. Jan Vogel.

834
01:00:37,806 --> 01:00:40,273
He's from Ermelo.

835
01:00:40,273 --> 01:00:43,405
His wife's been taken.

836
01:00:43,405 --> 01:00:46,273
It's for a bribe.

837
01:00:46,273 --> 01:00:49,505
Oh...
You are impossible.

838
01:00:49,505 --> 01:00:52,972
Now here...
I'll take care of it.

839
01:00:52,972 --> 01:00:55,572
Now will you please go to bed.

840
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:57,572
But Willem and Tine are coming.

841
01:00:57,572 --> 01:00:59,239
You can come down later.

842
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,839
Be sure and call me.

843
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:02,239
I will.

844
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:04,173
And use the steam kettle!

845
01:01:04,173 --> 01:01:05,939
Yeah, yeah.

846
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:30,639
I thought that today

847
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:33,306
the Lord would have
us read from Romans,

848
01:01:33,306 --> 01:01:36,439
Chapter 8.

849
01:01:36,439 --> 01:01:40,906
"What then can separate
us from Christ's love?

850
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,306
Can hardship or calamity?

851
01:01:44,306 --> 01:01:47,139
Can persecution or abuse?

852
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:49,739
If we are hungry or poor,

853
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:53,306
or in danger, or threatened with death.

854
01:01:53,306 --> 01:01:56,505
Does that mean that God has deserted us?

855
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,772
No! Despite all this,

856
01:01:58,772 --> 01:02:03,006
we have overwhelming victory
through Christ who loves us.

857
01:02:03,006 --> 01:02:06,505
For I am convinced that neither death

858
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:09,706
nor life nor the powers of Heaven,

859
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:12,106
nor the powers of Hell itself

860
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:15,372
can keep God's love from us.

861
01:02:15,372 --> 01:02:18,106
Nothing in the world as it is...

862
01:02:20,306 --> 01:02:22,906
Or the world as it shall be,

863
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,306
in the forces of the universe.

864
01:02:32,772 --> 01:02:37,972
...In all creation will
ever be able to separate us.

865
01:02:37,972 --> 01:02:41,106
Around the side door.

866
01:02:41,106 --> 01:02:43,472
Come on!

867
01:02:53,939 --> 01:02:56,706
Get upstairs.

868
01:03:07,206 --> 01:03:08,772
Corrie!

869
01:03:18,872 --> 01:03:22,139
Yes, I'm sorry we're closed until 2:00.

870
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:25,139
Miss Ten Boom, I...
I have an appointment with your sister.

871
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:27,972
Mr. Ah, Vogel?

872
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:29,806
I need the money.

873
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,073
Now!

874
01:03:32,372 --> 01:03:34,339
Yes, of course, I'll get it.

875
01:03:34,339 --> 01:03:36,006
Please, Miss Ten Boom!

876
01:03:36,006 --> 01:03:38,139
Places, everyone!

877
01:03:38,139 --> 01:03:40,472
Come on, hurry!

878
01:03:40,472 --> 01:03:42,006
Please, Miss Ten Boom!!!

879
01:03:42,006 --> 01:03:43,839
Yes, yes in a moment!!!

880
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,539
I'm just collecting it!

881
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,239
Oh!!!

882
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:58,006
Stay here!

883
01:03:58,006 --> 01:04:00,139
I'll take the top.

884
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,339
Miss Ten Boom?

885
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:07,339
Ten Boom...
Elizabeth.

886
01:04:14,273 --> 01:04:17,139
Where do you hide your ration cards?

887
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:19,006
I don't know what you're talking about.

888
01:04:19,006 --> 01:04:19,939
No!!!!

889
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,306
Where are the Jews?

890
01:04:21,306 --> 01:04:23,639
What Jews?

891
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:25,439
Oh! Lord Jesus, help me!

892
01:04:25,439 --> 01:04:27,073
Aaahhhh.

893
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:33,972
Where are the Jews?

894
01:04:33,972 --> 01:04:35,439
No, please.

895
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:37,806
Where is the secret room?

896
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:51,273
Corrie!

897
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,505
This must stop!!

898
01:04:57,273 --> 01:05:00,139
There's been no wrong done in this house.

899
01:05:00,139 --> 01:05:03,572
Then what are you doing with
all these ration cards,

900
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:06,505
feeding an army?

901
01:05:07,972 --> 01:05:10,206
What does it say in that book of yours

902
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,806
about obeying the government?

903
01:05:12,806 --> 01:05:14,006
Hum?

904
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:15,972
There comes a time...

905
01:05:15,972 --> 01:05:21,405
When we must choose
between God and man.

906
01:05:39,372 --> 01:05:41,173
Halt!!!!

907
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:13,972
Keep moving.

908
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:25,239
Nam, bitte?

909
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:28,472
Cornelia...
Ten Boom.

910
01:06:28,472 --> 01:06:30,106
Elizabeth.

911
01:06:30,106 --> 01:06:32,405
Your name?

912
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,605
Ten Boom, Casper.

913
01:06:58,273 --> 01:06:59,906
Papa!

914
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:05,206
Only six?

915
01:07:05,206 --> 01:07:07,572
Seven...

916
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:09,772
God is with us.

917
01:07:14,939 --> 01:07:16,706
Ten Boom...

918
01:07:18,605 --> 01:07:21,772
Give me your word you
will behave yourself,

919
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:25,639
and you can die in your bed, old man,

920
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:28,173
where you belong.

921
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:30,505
If I stay behind,

922
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:35,672
I will open my door to
anyone who knocks for help.

923
01:07:37,906 --> 01:07:39,672
Close it up.

924
01:07:49,439 --> 01:07:51,372
Seal the house.

925
01:09:35,173 --> 01:09:36,672
Clear the trucks!

926
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,672
Clear the trucks!

927
01:09:38,672 --> 01:09:40,605
Out! Out!

928
01:09:40,605 --> 01:09:42,239
Out!!!

929
01:09:54,073 --> 01:09:57,372
Corrie, take my hand.

930
01:09:57,372 --> 01:09:59,739
My sister, she needs a doctor.

931
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:01,372
Move on!!

932
01:10:01,372 --> 01:10:06,039
Papa! Papa!!!

933
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:09,273
God be with you papa!!

934
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:12,239
And with you, my daughters.

935
01:10:34,339 --> 01:10:36,639
I have to get in there.

936
01:10:52,372 --> 01:10:55,173
Fever down?

937
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:57,505
You had them worried...

938
01:10:57,505 --> 01:10:59,639
Typhus.

939
01:11:01,106 --> 01:11:03,839
Yesterday's rations,
I saved them for you.

940
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:07,173
Listen, I have family here.

941
01:11:07,173 --> 01:11:09,173
My sister, my brother,

942
01:11:09,173 --> 01:11:11,239
my father, my nephew--
the Ten Boom family.

943
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:13,405
Can you find out where they are?
Ssssshh!

944
01:11:13,405 --> 01:11:15,372
Maybe, listen...

945
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:17,906
I can get soap,
Aspirin, cigarettes.

946
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:20,672
You can pay me when you
start getting mail.

947
01:11:20,672 --> 01:11:24,672
Soap, 25 Guilders;
Aspirin, 50; Cigarettes, 100.

948
01:11:24,672 --> 01:11:26,572
Most anything!

949
01:11:26,572 --> 01:11:28,739
Can you get me a Bible?

950
01:12:40,505 --> 01:12:43,106
It's Kik! It's safe now.

951
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:49,706
Oh, thank God!

952
01:12:53,906 --> 01:12:56,206
Ssh! On the roof quickly.

953
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:58,772
The roof!

954
01:12:58,772 --> 01:13:01,672
Where are your family?

955
01:13:01,672 --> 01:13:03,339
Hurry!

956
01:13:04,872 --> 01:13:06,839
The Ten Booms?

957
01:13:06,839 --> 01:13:08,139
Still in prison.

958
01:13:08,139 --> 01:13:10,073
That's all we know.

959
01:13:11,672 --> 01:13:14,173
Mama made the coverlet on my bed...

960
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:17,706
It was in her trousseau.

961
01:13:17,706 --> 01:13:22,372
The painting by the mirror is a...

962
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:39,872
Do not go!

963
01:13:39,872 --> 01:13:44,273
Stay...
Please.

964
01:13:52,106 --> 01:13:54,472
They think I have to feed you.

965
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,139
Everybody's been released.

966
01:13:57,139 --> 01:13:58,139
Everybody?

967
01:13:58,139 --> 01:13:59,972
Except your sister Betsie,

968
01:13:59,972 --> 01:14:01,605
and your father, too, I think--

969
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:02,472
I'm not sure.

970
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:04,472
Oh, thank you, Lord!

971
01:14:04,472 --> 01:14:06,539
Oh Lord, thank you!

972
01:14:06,539 --> 01:14:10,505
Here's your bread from the warden's bakery...
Fresh!

973
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:21,706
Oh, Lord...
You have done wonders.

974
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:25,006
Don't I get a little credit.

975
01:14:25,006 --> 01:14:28,672
Lord, bless this angel.

976
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:32,039
Bless you!

977
01:14:34,372 --> 01:14:36,173
Do you think

978
01:14:36,173 --> 01:14:38,439
you can last here doing that?

979
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:39,839
Praying?

980
01:14:39,839 --> 01:14:41,839
The only way to live here...

981
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:43,772
Is to hate.

982
01:14:45,739 --> 01:14:48,939
Hate can put you in a
worse prison than this.

983
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:52,206
I have been 3 years in this hole.

984
01:14:52,206 --> 01:14:54,972
I worked my way to a position.

985
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:59,605
And I live to get the
swine who betrayed me.

986
01:15:01,505 --> 01:15:05,206
Now that's 75 Guilders!

987
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:30,372
Are you cold?

988
01:16:31,372 --> 01:16:34,073
It seems reasonably pleasant.

989
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:36,173
I'm sorry.

990
01:16:36,173 --> 01:16:40,039
Now you're here for violation
of the rationing rules.

991
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:43,106
Would you mind telling me

992
01:16:43,106 --> 01:16:45,839
where you got these extra ration cards?

993
01:16:45,839 --> 01:16:49,639
Sometimes they just appeared.

994
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:53,539
What do you mean...
appeared?

995
01:16:53,539 --> 01:16:55,872
Pushed under the door.

996
01:16:55,872 --> 01:16:59,139
Sometimes they were handed
to me in the market.

997
01:16:59,139 --> 01:17:01,039
By whom?

998
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:03,672
A Mr. Smit.

999
01:17:03,672 --> 01:17:06,239
Mr. Jan Smit?

1000
01:17:08,273 --> 01:17:11,672
Will you tell me about your other activities?

1001
01:17:14,605 --> 01:17:18,306
My sister and I held Bible classes,

1002
01:17:18,306 --> 01:17:21,539
until such meetings were forbidden.

1003
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:25,706
And we worked with retarded children.

1004
01:17:25,706 --> 01:17:28,106
How?

1005
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:29,106
Excuse me?

1006
01:17:29,106 --> 01:17:31,339
How would you work with them?

1007
01:17:31,339 --> 01:17:33,872
We taught them about God.

1008
01:17:35,772 --> 01:17:37,273
What a waste.

1009
01:17:37,273 --> 01:17:39,139
If you wanted converts,

1010
01:17:39,139 --> 01:17:41,472
surely one normal person is worth

1011
01:17:41,472 --> 01:17:43,806
all the half-wits in the world.

1012
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:46,772
In the eyes of God,

1013
01:17:46,772 --> 01:17:50,405
one simple child may be
worth more than...

1014
01:17:50,405 --> 01:17:52,672
... a watchmaker's daughter.

1015
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:55,306
Perhaps...

1016
01:17:55,306 --> 01:18:00,539
But I know he keeps me
always in his sight.

1017
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:03,073
You actually believe that?

1018
01:18:03,073 --> 01:18:06,906
I believe that you are in
his sight too, lieutenant.

1019
01:18:12,372 --> 01:18:15,273
Tell me, Miss Ten Boom,

1020
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,405
how can you believe in a God

1021
01:18:17,405 --> 01:18:20,339
who lets an old man die in prison?

1022
01:18:20,339 --> 01:18:24,939
His body forgotten somewhere
in a pauper's grave.

1023
01:18:24,939 --> 01:18:28,906
My father?

1024
01:18:28,906 --> 01:18:34,039
I understand he was taken
ill after about 10 days.

1025
01:18:34,039 --> 01:18:37,173
He was taken to a hospital in the Haag,

1026
01:18:37,173 --> 01:18:39,706
unfortunately, there were no beds available.

1027
01:18:39,706 --> 01:18:42,539
He seemingly died in the hallway.

1028
01:18:42,539 --> 01:18:46,306
Some failure of organization.

1029
01:18:46,306 --> 01:18:51,139
Under such circumstances where
no one claims the body,

1030
01:18:51,139 --> 01:18:54,206
it is difficult to trace.

1031
01:18:54,206 --> 01:19:00,206
I know where my father is, lieutenant.

1032
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,939
That will be all, Miss Ten Boom.

1033
01:19:09,872 --> 01:19:13,073
Oh, you have news from home.

1034
01:19:57,106 --> 01:20:03,739
Papa...
Papa.

1035
01:21:03,706 --> 01:21:06,505
Snell, snell, snell!!

1036
01:21:50,706 --> 01:21:53,872
Snell, snell.

1037
01:22:21,006 --> 01:22:24,039
Betsie!! Betsie!!

1038
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:26,439
Corrie, oh!!!!

1039
01:22:27,173 --> 01:22:29,372
It's my sister!

1040
01:22:29,372 --> 01:22:31,173
Betsie!

1041
01:22:32,173 --> 01:22:33,439
Betsie!

1042
01:22:42,173 --> 01:22:44,239
Betsie!!!!

1043
01:22:46,173 --> 01:22:47,639
Betsie!

1044
01:22:49,706 --> 01:22:51,739
Corrie!!!!

1045
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:43,472
Snell!!! Snell!!

1046
01:26:09,472 --> 01:26:11,239
Snell!

1047
01:27:04,006 --> 01:27:07,472
Nobody is permitted to keep
any personal possession.

1048
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,472
There will be no exceptions.

1049
01:27:21,605 --> 01:27:23,605
Remove your clothes...

1050
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:25,639
I can't!

1051
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:27,505
They're taking everything.

1052
01:27:27,505 --> 01:27:30,039
What he's asked us to do,
he'll help us to do.

1053
01:27:30,039 --> 01:27:32,372
Do you want us to die for a little skin?

1054
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:33,505
I can't.

1055
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:35,106
There will be no exceptions.

1056
01:27:35,106 --> 01:27:36,039
Where are you going?

1057
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:37,139
Toilets, please!

1058
01:27:37,139 --> 01:27:39,339
Showers--
use the drain holes.

1059
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:43,372
Please understand,
she's been very ill.

1060
01:27:44,906 --> 01:27:46,239
Name?

1061
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:48,539
Bridget Marie.

1062
01:27:48,539 --> 01:27:49,372
Name?

1063
01:27:49,372 --> 01:27:50,839
Priest, Frances.

1064
01:27:55,806 --> 01:27:57,839
Quick, take off your sweater.

1065
01:27:59,972 --> 01:28:01,972
Hurry!

1066
01:28:03,372 --> 01:28:06,572
They'll send us back here after we shower.

1067
01:28:10,939 --> 01:28:12,472
I can't!

1068
01:28:12,472 --> 01:28:14,706
Yes, yes, you can. Hurry!

1069
01:28:16,472 --> 01:28:18,405
Danke!

1070
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:02,439
I got my shoes!

1071
01:29:07,906 --> 01:29:10,306
How much for underwear?

1072
01:29:10,306 --> 01:29:13,439
A week's bread ration.

1073
01:29:17,472 --> 01:29:19,372
Next!

1074
01:29:19,372 --> 01:29:21,306
Next!!

1075
01:29:21,306 --> 01:29:23,106
Oh, Lord...

1076
01:29:23,106 --> 01:29:25,206
You have given us your word

1077
01:29:25,206 --> 01:29:27,706
and hidden it through everything!

1078
01:29:27,706 --> 01:29:31,039
Now open up a way for us to get
it through the gates of Hell.

1079
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:34,806
Achtung!
Achtung!

1080
01:29:34,806 --> 01:29:36,939
It's in God's hands now.

1081

The hell you do!

1109
01:31:13,273 --> 01:31:15,505
Fleas!

1110
01:31:15,505 --> 01:31:17,505
Lice!

1111
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,839
Can you imagine what mama would say?

1112
01:31:24,839 --> 01:31:27,273
Achtung!
Achtung!

1113
01:31:31,006 --> 01:31:36,273
Ravensbruck is not a rest camp.

1114
01:31:38,806 --> 01:31:42,006
Roll call, 4:30 every morning.

1115
01:31:43,106 --> 01:31:45,839
...7 days a week.

1116
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:51,039
Tomorrow, assignment to work details.

1117
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:55,839
Those who cannot work
report to sick call...

1118
01:31:55,839 --> 01:32:00,139
and they better be sick!

1119
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:03,439
You will receive 1/2 pound of bread

1120
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:06,772
and 1/2 liter of soup per day.

1121
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:11,539
One small observation upon
which your life depends--

1122
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:15,539
there is only one road to freedom...

1123
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:18,239
Work!

1124
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:28,872
Get it up!

1125
01:32:28,872 --> 01:32:30,639
Hoist it.

1126
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:40,906
Snell!.

1127
01:32:56,039 --> 01:32:58,639
Snell!!

1128
01:33:00,872 --> 01:33:02,972
Snell!!

1129
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:38,173
You are Dutch?

1130
01:33:40,173 --> 01:33:42,539
Some of my people are Dutch...

1131
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:47,839
On my mother's side.

1132
01:33:47,839 --> 01:33:52,139
You are not the only one
surprised to be here.

1133
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:56,772
I thought I would be working
at a relocation center...

1134
01:33:57,772 --> 01:33:59,273
Refugees.

1135
01:34:11,206 --> 01:34:14,439
The supplies are extremely limited.

1136
01:34:14,439 --> 01:34:18,539
An accurate record is essential

1137
01:34:18,539 --> 01:34:21,405
I know my way around hospitals,

1138
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:23,505
I was kind of nurse once.

1139
01:34:23,505 --> 01:34:26,939
I assume that is why you
were assigned here.

1140
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:28,572
A midwife...

1141
01:34:28,572 --> 01:34:31,306
I brought Jewish babies into the world.

1142
01:34:35,372 --> 01:34:38,372
You are never to touch
the things in here:

1143
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:44,006
Soap, vitamins, painkillers,
yeast, quinine.

1144
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,106
I have the only key to this cupboard.

1145
01:34:51,706 --> 01:34:54,073
However...

1146
01:34:54,073 --> 01:34:58,039
You will find that I often forget to lock up.

1147
01:34:59,806 --> 01:35:05,073
I hope you understand, 66685.

1148
01:35:58,906 --> 01:36:03,739
Oh...
Thank you, Lord!

1149
01:36:07,106 --> 01:36:10,273
He doesn't expect thanks for this.

1150
01:36:10,273 --> 01:36:12,872
It's warm.

1151
01:36:12,872 --> 01:36:16,739
I'm thankful for every
moment we can be together.

1152
01:36:16,739 --> 01:36:18,639
Yeah!

1153
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,139
We can at least lie down tonight.

1154
01:36:25,206 --> 01:36:28,039
There has to be a plan, Corrie.

1155
01:36:31,273 --> 01:36:36,173
I won't be grateful for the lice.

1156
01:36:38,772 --> 01:36:41,706
God doesn't make mistakes.

1157
01:36:45,006 --> 01:36:47,505
How is it at the hospital?

1158
01:36:47,505 --> 01:36:50,439
Is it true your temperature has
to be over 104 to be admitted?

1159
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:52,706
That's the rule.

1160
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:54,839
There's a guard in the laundry.

1161
01:36:54,839 --> 01:36:57,006
You can get underwear for a price.

1162
01:36:57,006 --> 01:36:58,106
What does she want?

1163
01:36:58,106 --> 01:36:59,306
Bread rations.

1164
01:36:59,306 --> 01:37:01,073
Don't cut too much!

1165
01:37:01,073 --> 01:37:03,572
What do you want, hair or lice!?

1166
01:37:03,572 --> 01:37:07,772
You'll learn to love the little darlings.

1167
01:37:07,772 --> 01:37:11,639
The guards won't step foot in this lice pit.

1168
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:14,972
Past the door, we can do anything.

1169
01:37:14,972 --> 01:37:18,339
Even lice!

1170
01:37:56,173 --> 01:37:58,605
6-6-7-2-7.

1171
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:04,439
6-6-7-2-7!

1172
01:38:06,872 --> 01:38:09,239
6-6-7-2-7 is missing!!

1173
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:14,039
♪ La, la, la, la, ♪

1174

1176
01:38:34,772 --> 01:38:37,572
Somebody overslept.

1177
01:38:37,572 --> 01:38:39,173
The loony.

1178
01:38:42,372 --> 01:38:44,739
Oh, Corrie...

1179
01:38:44,739 --> 01:38:47,472
We are in hell!

1180
01:39:12,372 --> 01:39:15,106
Why do they keep us so long?

1181
01:39:15,106 --> 01:39:17,639
To break us.

1182
01:39:20,106 --> 01:39:22,605
Betsie, look!

1183
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:35,906
I was certain no one would die,

1184
01:39:35,906 --> 01:39:39,173
that we would all go home.

1185
01:39:39,173 --> 01:39:42,739
Those days on the train--

1186
01:39:42,739 --> 01:39:47,006
the Lord seemed to promise.

1187
01:39:50,206 --> 01:39:54,273
How could I have misunderstood?

1188
01:39:57,706 --> 01:40:01,639
Oh, dear Father, help me.

1189
01:40:02,605 --> 01:40:05,173
Don't let me listen to my voice

1190
01:40:05,173 --> 01:40:07,972
and think it is yours!

1191
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:14,006
Oh Jesus...

1192
01:40:14,006 --> 01:40:17,472
Show me how to live in this place.

1193
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:25,139
You too love him?

1194
01:41:26,806 --> 01:41:30,173
Here, put these in the mattress.

1195
01:41:30,173 --> 01:41:33,206
Not now! It's yeast,

1196
01:41:33,206 --> 01:41:35,472
and don't go spooning it around.

1197
01:41:35,472 --> 01:41:37,872
I can never get enough for everybody.

1198
01:41:47,639 --> 01:41:50,706
This method consisted of

1199
01:41:50,706 --> 01:41:53,239
painting only small dots

1200
01:41:53,239 --> 01:41:56,372
of pure colors on the canvas.

1201
01:41:56,372 --> 01:41:59,372
And color blending was achieved

1202
01:41:59,372 --> 01:42:03,706
by placing dots of different
colors next to each other.

1203
01:42:03,706 --> 01:42:09,372
And then from a distance the
two colors appeared blended

1204
01:42:09,372 --> 01:42:12,239
into one single new color.

1205
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:15,139
Jesus Christ has made it possible

1206
01:42:15,139 --> 01:42:19,572
for us to have direct access.

1207
01:42:22,039 --> 01:42:24,505
There's a repeat at that point.

1208
01:42:24,505 --> 01:42:26,439
In the second movement?

1209
01:42:27,772 --> 01:42:30,706
That is a retardondo at
the end of the third bar.

Seig heil!

1222
01:43:37,206 --> 01:43:39,206
German whores...

1223
01:43:39,206 --> 01:43:41,505
We ran them through the hospital...

1224
01:43:41,505 --> 01:43:42,739
Infected.

1225
01:43:42,739 --> 01:43:45,039
What's with the yellow badge?

1226
01:43:46,273 --> 01:43:48,439
Race defiler...

1227
01:43:48,439 --> 01:43:51,372
Caught her with a Slavic laborer.

1228
01:43:53,739 --> 01:43:56,939
She's just a child.

1229
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:13,539
Oh...
You've trod on my foot.

1230
01:44:13,539 --> 01:44:15,039
Oh!

1231
01:44:25,672 --> 01:44:29,173
Snell, snell.

1232
01:44:32,073 --> 01:44:34,939
Don't exert yourself, countess.

1233
01:44:34,939 --> 01:44:38,106
Oh, it's all I can carry.

1234
01:44:38,106 --> 01:44:42,639
Any more, and I'll have
to stop altogether.

1235
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:44,939
I decide who stops!

1236
01:44:44,939 --> 01:44:49,639
Oh! Oh, oh! Oh!

1237
01:44:52,139 --> 01:44:54,273
Oh, oh!

1238
01:44:54,273 --> 01:44:57,972
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1239
01:44:57,972 --> 01:45:01,505
I decide who stops.

1240
01:45:03,739 --> 01:45:04,939
No!

1241
01:45:10,972 --> 01:45:16,039
No hate, Corrie...
No hate.

1242
01:45:20,906 --> 01:45:22,972
I want the most warm vest.

1243
01:45:22,972 --> 01:45:25,372
You owe 2 day's bread!!

1244
01:45:27,539 --> 01:45:30,073
I...I can pay you next week.

1245
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,472
No!

1246
01:45:35,839 --> 01:45:38,239
Oh! Dumpkopff.

1247
01:45:41,706 --> 01:45:46,439
Jesus knows everything we feel.

1248
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:51,772
He promised that when 2 or 3
get together in his name,

1249
01:45:51,772 --> 01:45:54,572
he would be there with them...

1250
01:45:54,572 --> 01:45:57,806
Even in Ravensbruck!

1251
01:45:57,806 --> 01:46:02,139
In our lives before,

1252
01:46:02,139 --> 01:46:07,173
we would have been
separated by so much;

1253
01:46:07,173 --> 01:46:12,206
but here, all that has
been stripped away.

1254
01:46:12,206 --> 01:46:19,572
And we see the truth:
Jesus in each one of us;

1255
01:46:19,572 --> 01:46:24,006
light in this darkness...

1256
01:46:24,006 --> 01:46:29,039
And we can praise Him together.

1257
01:46:51,372 --> 01:46:55,972
Father...
Bless the German people.

1258
01:46:55,972 --> 01:46:59,872
From your great storehouse of love,

1259
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:03,106
forgive them for Jesus' sake.

1260
01:47:03,106 --> 01:47:06,605
Do not hold this place to their charge,

1261
01:47:06,605 --> 01:47:12,206
forgive them, even before they know to ask.

1262
01:47:18,173 --> 01:47:20,173
I'll give you one.

1263
01:47:20,173 --> 01:47:23,206
Two--or else you don't want the scarf!

1264
01:47:24,739 --> 01:47:26,706
I'll give you one now, one tomorrow.

1265
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:28,939
I'll find you.

1266
01:48:48,672 --> 01:48:51,706
Come on now, rub it!

1267
01:48:52,206 --> 01:48:54,139
Rub it in!

1268
01:48:55,505 --> 01:48:58,472
A whole transport of Poles
came in last night.

1269
01:48:58,472 --> 01:49:00,106
Vulture.

1270
01:49:00,106 --> 01:49:02,739
You should know.

1271
01:49:05,173 --> 01:49:06,906
I have an undervest.

1272
01:49:06,906 --> 01:49:08,339
Eyes front!

1273
01:49:08,339 --> 01:49:09,273
It is wool.

1274
01:49:09,273 --> 01:49:10,939
No!!

1275
01:49:10,939 --> 01:49:12,706
Two days' bread ration.

1276
01:49:12,706 --> 01:49:14,239
My comb.

1277
01:49:16,405 --> 01:49:18,706
I'll collect later.

1278
01:49:18,706 --> 01:49:20,639
Nothing for the comb.

1279
01:49:21,706 --> 01:49:23,672
Rub hard!

1280
01:49:24,706 --> 01:49:26,306
Rub it in.

1281
01:49:26,306 --> 01:49:27,639
Thank you.

1282
01:49:34,706 --> 01:49:36,206
Oh!...

1283
01:49:36,206 --> 01:49:40,605
The sky is so peaceful.

1284
01:49:44,806 --> 01:49:48,139
You politicals don't have
anything to do with trash.

1285
01:49:48,139 --> 01:49:52,806
Ah!

1286
01:49:53,972 --> 01:49:56,539
We are all trash.

1287
01:50:01,372 --> 01:50:04,206
I took it off a tray...
In the infirmary.

1288
01:50:06,505 --> 01:50:07,872
Oh!!

1289
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,772
Aaaaah!

1290
01:50:10,706 --> 01:50:13,039
Aaaaahhh!

1291
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:15,372
Continue--
continue!

1292
01:50:15,372 --> 01:50:18,073
Ooooohh!

1293
01:50:42,039 --> 01:50:45,505
I though you were smart.

1294
01:50:45,505 --> 01:50:49,372
Ooooohh!
Aaahhh!!

1295
01:50:49,372 --> 01:50:52,039
You called attention to
yourself in the line.

1296
01:50:53,239 --> 01:50:54,706
Imbecile!

1297
01:50:54,706 --> 01:50:57,306
Could you not wait until you
were back in the block?

1298
01:50:57,306 --> 01:50:59,605
Are you such a greedy fool?

1299
01:50:59,605 --> 01:51:02,039
You German cow!!!

1300
01:51:03,372 --> 01:51:05,372
Maybe I should have let them kill you.

1301
01:51:05,372 --> 01:51:07,872
You great... Lumbering...
Hun!!!

1302
01:51:07,872 --> 01:51:09,505
Maybe you'd like to go in the box.

1303
01:51:09,505 --> 01:51:11,505
Box!! No light, no water.

1304
01:51:11,505 --> 01:51:14,872
You will never do anything
that stupid again.

1305
01:51:14,872 --> 01:51:17,039
Never!

1306
01:51:17,039 --> 01:51:20,605
Oooooooohhhh...

1307
01:51:23,173 --> 01:51:25,339
Now I will...

1308
01:51:25,339 --> 01:51:27,739
I will dress your hand.

1309
01:51:36,706 --> 01:51:39,173
"Comfort the frightened,

1310
01:51:39,173 --> 01:51:41,173
help the weak,

1311
01:51:41,173 --> 01:51:44,039
be patient with everyone.

1312
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:47,139
Do not repay evil for evil,

1313
01:51:47,139 --> 01:51:51,239
but always try to do good to one another.

1314
01:51:51,239 --> 01:51:53,439
Always rejoice.

1315
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:55,806
Pray constantly,

1316
01:51:55,806 --> 01:52:00,772
give thanks in all circumstances,

1317
01:52:00,772 --> 01:52:05,672
for this is the will of
God in Jesus Christ.

1318
01:52:05,672 --> 01:52:07,839
And to the mindless,

1319
01:52:07,839 --> 01:52:10,339
the words sound so comforting.

1320
01:52:10,339 --> 01:52:13,239
In this place it's mockery!

1321
01:52:16,006 --> 01:52:18,505
God didn't make this place...

1322
01:52:18,505 --> 01:52:20,206
Men did!

1323
01:52:20,206 --> 01:52:22,006
But He has power...

1324
01:52:22,006 --> 01:52:24,006
Surely He could stop them.

1325
01:52:24,006 --> 01:52:26,505
Unless, of course,
He's a sadist.

1326
01:52:26,505 --> 01:52:29,006
No! He's love, all love.

1327
01:52:29,006 --> 01:52:31,006
Then he's impotent.

1328
01:52:31,006 --> 01:52:33,339
You can't have it both ways, my dear!

1329
01:52:33,339 --> 01:52:36,173
You see what's around you.

1330
01:52:36,173 --> 01:52:40,039
We see another world,
just as real...

1331
01:52:40,039 --> 01:52:42,439
Our life with God.

1332
01:52:42,439 --> 01:52:48,806
Every day it gets deeper and stronger.

1333
01:52:48,806 --> 01:52:52,505
You think the two can't
exist side by side,

1334
01:52:52,505 --> 01:52:54,672
but we know they do!

1335
01:52:54,672 --> 01:52:56,806
We live them both!

1336
01:52:57,972 --> 01:53:01,239
It's enough knowing that
we're so much dung,

1337
01:53:01,239 --> 01:53:04,173
moving from nothing to nothing.

1338
01:53:04,173 --> 01:53:07,006
But you must believe your God

1339
01:53:07,006 --> 01:53:10,039
smells that stench from those chimneys

1340
01:53:10,039 --> 01:53:13,939
and refuses to do anything!

1341
01:53:15,639 --> 01:53:21,906
If only...
you could know his love.

1342
01:53:23,972 --> 01:53:26,339
I am Maria Wrochek...

1343
01:53:27,939 --> 01:53:32,405
First violinist of the
Warsaw Symphony Orchestra.

1344
01:53:32,405 --> 01:53:37,339
Did your God will this?

1345
01:53:48,339 --> 01:53:50,839
We cannot answer.

1346
01:53:50,839 --> 01:53:56,106
All I can say is that the
same God you are accusing

1347
01:53:56,106 --> 01:54:00,605
came and lived in the midst of our world.

1348
01:54:00,605 --> 01:54:04,505
He was beaten...
And He was mocked

1349
01:54:04,505 --> 01:54:07,739
and He died on a cross.

1350
01:54:07,739 --> 01:54:13,206
And He did it for love...
for us.

1351
01:54:13,206 --> 01:54:16,206
And why do you think

1352
01:54:16,206 --> 01:54:20,139
your God of love sent you here?

1353
01:54:25,706 --> 01:54:28,139
To obey Him...

1354
01:54:28,139 --> 01:54:32,039
If you know Him...

1355
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:34,972
You don't have to know why.

1356
01:54:37,672 --> 01:54:40,405
First you take the juice of four oranges,

1357
01:54:40,405 --> 01:54:43,006
and a half a pint of cream,

1358
01:54:43,006 --> 01:54:45,405
and a cup of sugar.

1359
01:54:45,405 --> 01:54:47,706
I only use 3/4 of a cup.

1360
01:54:47,706 --> 01:54:49,739
You should use a full cup.

1361
01:54:49,739 --> 01:54:53,372
Then you put the peels
aside for grating,

1362
01:54:53,372 --> 01:54:55,339
and you whip the cream.

1363
01:54:55,339 --> 01:54:57,472
What kind of cook are you?

1364
01:54:57,472 --> 01:54:59,006
You forgot the eggs.

1365
01:54:59,006 --> 01:55:02,206
Do your own recipe, then.

1366
01:55:07,339 --> 01:55:10,139
We need more sand.

1367
01:55:16,306 --> 01:55:18,273
Corrie...

1368
01:55:20,505 --> 01:55:22,839
Corrie...

1369
01:55:22,839 --> 01:55:25,006
Don't shut me out...

1370
01:55:25,006 --> 01:55:27,539
Please.

1371
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:32,972
You know you can only
give it to Jesus.

1372
01:55:32,972 --> 01:55:35,139
Do you think I haven't prayed?

1373
01:55:35,139 --> 01:55:37,306
But I hate them.

1374
01:55:37,306 --> 01:55:40,006
I hate every Nazi in this place!

1375
01:55:40,006 --> 01:55:44,339
We can't be more than what we are.

1376
01:55:46,106 --> 01:55:49,939
Only Jesus can free us from ourselves;

1377
01:55:49,939 --> 01:55:52,106
from whatever happens.

1378
01:55:52,106 --> 01:55:56,806
Sister...
You can't protect me.

1379
01:55:56,806 --> 01:55:59,239
You mustn't try.

1380
01:56:26,972 --> 01:56:30,006
Lord...

1381
01:56:30,006 --> 01:56:35,739
I cannot let go of it.

1382
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:42,073
Take this hate...

1383
01:56:42,073 --> 01:56:46,273
Out of my life

1384
01:56:46,273 --> 01:56:51,739
and put your love in its place.

1385
01:56:56,772 --> 01:57:03,173
Jesus, there are many
things I do not understand.

1386
01:57:06,672 --> 01:57:10,306
Do not let me go mad...

1387
01:57:10,306 --> 01:57:14,572
poking about on my own.

1388
01:57:16,405 --> 01:57:19,472
You know what I am.

1389
01:57:24,839 --> 01:57:27,772
Saviour...

1390
01:57:31,173 --> 01:57:34,605
Hide me in the center of your will.

1391
01:57:52,339 --> 01:57:54,273
How long?

1392
01:57:57,073 --> 01:57:59,472
Four months.

1393
01:57:59,472 --> 01:58:02,405
What's it to you?

1394
01:58:02,405 --> 01:58:05,339
Child...

1395
01:58:05,339 --> 01:58:08,539
You would like to see me cry, wouldn't you?

1396
01:58:08,539 --> 01:58:10,839
Then you could mother me.

1397
01:58:10,839 --> 01:58:14,173
I only want to help.

1398
01:58:14,173 --> 01:58:16,706
What difference would it make?

1399
01:58:16,706 --> 01:58:19,273
Everything dies here.

1400
01:58:24,306 --> 01:58:27,472
Kraut! A lousy little whore!

1401
01:58:27,472 --> 01:58:30,273
We need vitamins and all
the calcium you can get.

1402
01:58:30,273 --> 01:58:32,339
You are so damned naive.

1403
01:58:32,339 --> 01:58:34,872
Two years older--
she'd be standing over you with a whip!

1404
01:58:34,872 --> 01:58:37,372
It's a baby, Katje, a new life!

1405
01:58:37,372 --> 01:58:39,539
I am not your personal Red Cross!

1406
01:58:39,539 --> 01:58:43,939
I can never get enough for
you, and her, and Betsie too!

1407
01:58:56,139 --> 01:58:58,073
What are you doing!?

1408
01:58:58,073 --> 01:58:59,939
Nothing! I was just...

1409
01:58:59,939 --> 01:59:02,006
I said "what were you doing?"

1410
01:59:02,006 --> 01:59:05,006
We have a pregnancy in 28.

1411
01:59:05,006 --> 01:59:06,939
A kid of 18.
She's...

1412
01:59:06,939 --> 01:59:08,939
I do not want to know!

1413
01:59:08,939 --> 01:59:12,505
All pregnancies are
transferred to experimental.

1414
02:00:00,839 --> 02:00:03,706
Yeast, B vitamins.

1415
02:00:03,706 --> 02:00:05,839
It'll help keep your soup down.

1416
02:00:05,839 --> 02:00:08,772
We even have a midwife.

1417
02:00:29,339 --> 02:00:34,106
Group 5 of 100 women,
report to the inspector.

1418
02:00:35,339 --> 02:00:39,306
Prisoner 146723

1419
02:00:39,306 --> 02:00:43,505
report to administration
for processing.

1420
02:00:55,106 --> 02:00:57,605
All this German slop has
to be good for something.

1421
02:00:57,605 --> 02:00:59,605
German papers, thick...

1422
02:00:59,605 --> 02:01:02,706
Like German heads!

1423
02:01:02,706 --> 02:01:04,706
It's a lot of hot air!

1424
02:01:04,706 --> 02:01:07,039
The yanks are halfway to the Rhine.

1425
02:01:07,939 --> 02:01:11,139
Oh!
So...

1426
02:01:11,139 --> 02:01:16,239
We'll put some hot air
between you and the wind.

1427
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:20,239
Katje, thank you!

1428
02:01:24,906 --> 02:01:27,405
It's funny about you two.

1429
02:01:27,405 --> 02:01:29,772
Oh, well tell us...

1430
02:01:29,772 --> 02:01:32,039
We need a laugh!

1431
02:01:32,039 --> 02:01:34,772
You're always talking about love.

1432
02:01:34,772 --> 02:01:37,339
I bet neither of you ever had a man.

1433
02:01:43,273 --> 02:01:45,539
We had boyfriends.

1434
02:01:50,839 --> 02:01:53,639
Did you love your baby's father?

1435
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:55,839
I was hungry.

1436
02:01:55,839 --> 02:01:58,239
He was nice to me.

1437
02:02:14,706 --> 02:02:17,605
I feel so strange.

1438
02:02:17,605 --> 02:02:19,839
I hurt!

1439
02:02:19,839 --> 02:02:21,839
I can't.

1440
02:02:21,839 --> 02:02:23,572
Well, try.

1441
02:02:23,572 --> 02:02:25,372
It goes like wood.

1442
02:02:25,372 --> 02:02:27,505
Oh, I am so weak!

1443
02:02:27,505 --> 02:02:30,972
Thank God--
He is strong.

1444
02:02:30,972 --> 02:02:34,639
Katje, Katje!

1445
02:03:48,939 --> 02:03:52,339
Betsie, try...
Please try.

1446
02:03:52,339 --> 02:03:54,439
Yeah.

1447
02:03:54,439 --> 02:03:56,972
Oh...
You know, Corrie,

1448
02:03:56,972 --> 02:03:58,772
we're...

1449
02:03:58,772 --> 02:04:01,906
we're going to be free!

1450
02:04:01,906 --> 02:04:07,139
Before the new year--
both of us.

1451
02:04:08,339 --> 02:04:10,672
Both of us?

1452
02:04:10,672 --> 02:04:14,073
The Lord showed me...

1453
02:04:14,073 --> 02:04:16,539
In a dream.

1454
02:04:16,539 --> 02:04:19,173
You'll see!

1455
02:04:22,839 --> 02:04:26,372
I'm not going to die, Corrie.

1456
02:04:26,372 --> 02:04:29,073
Oh...
No.

1457
02:04:44,006 --> 02:04:46,006
Far enough.

1458
02:04:46,006 --> 02:04:47,839
Leave her there.

1459
02:04:47,839 --> 02:04:49,339
Oh, please.

1460
02:04:49,339 --> 02:04:50,839
Leave her!!

1461
02:04:50,839 --> 02:04:54,439
All prisoners report to the Lagerstrasse.

1462
02:04:59,906 --> 02:05:01,206
Oh!

1463
02:05:02,039 --> 02:05:03,872
Ah!!

1464
02:05:10,106 --> 02:05:12,239
Please let me stay with her.

1465
02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:14,006
Roll call!!

1466
02:05:40,106 --> 02:05:44,206
Block 41...
Dismissed.

1467
02:05:47,239 --> 02:05:50,605
Block 28...
Dismissed.

1468
02:05:52,605 --> 02:05:56,039
Block 33...
Dismissed.

1469
02:05:58,505 --> 02:06:01,906
Block 35...
Dismissed.

1470
02:06:07,539 --> 02:06:10,039
Betsie!!

1471
02:06:10,039 --> 02:06:13,239
The prisoner is being transferred
to the hospital.

1472
02:06:13,239 --> 02:06:16,839
Prisoner 66730 requests permission
to accompany her sister.

1473
02:06:16,839 --> 02:06:19,872
What is the count?

1474
02:06:19,872 --> 02:06:22,539
Block 20: 4 dead.

1475
02:06:22,539 --> 02:06:24,539
Block 21: 3 dead.

1476
02:06:24,539 --> 02:06:26,472
Block 22: 6 dead.

1477
02:06:26,472 --> 02:06:28,273
Go on!

1478
02:06:28,273 --> 02:06:30,339
Block 23: Clear.

1479
02:06:30,339 --> 02:06:32,139
There should be more;
Count again.

1480
02:06:32,139 --> 02:06:33,672
Betsie!

1481
02:06:33,672 --> 02:06:35,539
Sister!

1482
02:06:38,405 --> 02:06:41,006
Thank Him, Corrie.

1483
02:06:41,006 --> 02:06:43,672
Thank the Lord...

1484
02:06:43,672 --> 02:06:45,806
For all He has done for us here.

1485
02:06:45,806 --> 02:06:48,006
Oh, you'll be warm soon.

1486
02:06:48,006 --> 02:06:50,672
Together...
You and I...

1487
02:06:50,672 --> 02:06:52,906
Always together.

1488
02:06:52,906 --> 02:06:54,906
Yeah!

1489
02:07:39,672 --> 02:07:42,106
Water.

1490
02:08:43,739 --> 02:08:46,239
Could I sleep here?

1491
02:08:46,239 --> 02:08:48,206
Just tonight?

1492
02:08:48,206 --> 02:08:50,372
It's so cold.

1493
02:08:50,372 --> 02:08:52,972
This way we would have 2 blankets.

1494
02:09:09,639 --> 02:09:14,505
If God loved Betsie so much...

1495
02:09:14,505 --> 02:09:17,173
Why?

1496
02:09:23,306 --> 02:09:26,006
Suffering does not mean

1497
02:09:26,006 --> 02:09:29,306
that God has stopped loving us.

1498
02:09:31,339 --> 02:09:35,539
Sometimes...
We have to accept things

1499
02:09:35,539 --> 02:09:39,139
we do not understand.

1500
02:09:39,139 --> 02:09:42,539
I love Betsie...

1501
02:09:42,539 --> 02:09:46,472
And I love you!

1502
02:11:43,672 --> 02:11:46,806
This is the sister.

1503
02:12:07,173 --> 02:12:11,872
Corrie...
You must look...

1504
02:12:11,872 --> 02:12:14,706
Otherwise, you'll never know.

1505
02:12:40,139 --> 02:12:44,106
She's beautiful.

1506
02:12:56,672 --> 02:12:59,839
Betsie!

1507
02:13:25,806 --> 02:13:29,872
We shall do

1508
02:13:29,872 --> 02:13:33,372
a great many things for others.

1509
02:13:33,372 --> 02:13:38,073
And we must go everywhere.

1510
02:13:38,073 --> 02:13:44,505
We must tell people

1511
02:13:44,505 --> 02:13:49,139
that no pit is so deep...

1512
02:13:49,139 --> 02:13:54,605
That he is not deeper still.

1513
02:13:54,605 --> 02:13:59,472
They will believe us...

1514
02:13:59,472 --> 02:14:03,872
because we were here.

1515
02:14:04,939 --> 02:14:08,006
Betsie talked about heaven

1516
02:14:08,006 --> 02:14:10,472
like she had already been there.

1517
02:14:10,472 --> 02:14:13,372
Yeah!

1518
02:14:13,372 --> 02:14:16,339
No one would wish her back.

1519
02:14:16,339 --> 02:14:18,939
Read for Betsie.

1520
02:14:18,939 --> 02:14:21,239
Read for all of us.

1521
02:14:35,039 --> 02:14:38,739
"For we know that our earthly bodies,

1522
02:14:38,739 --> 02:14:44,739
those we have now,
which will die--

1523
02:14:44,739 --> 02:14:48,872
must be changed for
our heavenly bodies,

1524
02:14:48,872 --> 02:14:52,472
which will not die...

1525
02:14:52,472 --> 02:14:55,372
But live forever.

1526
02:14:55,372 --> 02:14:58,806
Then the scripture will be fulfilled:

1527
02:14:58,806 --> 02:15:04,206
Death is swallowed up in victory."

1528
02:15:04,206 --> 02:15:06,872
So my dear ones...

1529
02:15:06,872 --> 02:15:11,006
Since future victory is sure,

1530
02:15:11,006 --> 02:15:15,139
be strong, and steady...

1531
02:15:15,139 --> 02:15:19,605
Always abounding in the work of the Lord.

1532
02:15:19,605 --> 02:15:25,106
For we know that our labor in the Lord

1533
02:15:25,106 --> 02:15:28,572
is not in vain...

1534
02:15:28,572 --> 02:15:33,139
As it would be if there
were no resurrection.

1535
02:15:35,173 --> 02:15:38,605
And this is the good news:

1536
02:15:38,605 --> 02:15:41,605
That Christ died for our sins

1537
02:15:41,605 --> 02:15:43,806
according to the scriptures.

1538
02:15:43,806 --> 02:15:47,472
And that He Rose again,
just as the prophets had said.

1539
02:15:47,472 --> 02:15:53,073
For God so loved the world that
He gave His only begotten son,

1540
02:15:53,073 --> 02:15:57,806
that anyone who believes
in Him shall not die...

1541
02:15:57,806 --> 02:16:01,739
But has eternal life!

1542
02:16:18,939 --> 02:16:20,872
Halt!

1543
02:16:23,672 --> 02:16:26,039
Achtung!

1544
02:16:27,806 --> 02:16:30,806
The following prisoners
will come forward

1545
02:16:30,806 --> 02:16:34,006
and stand by for selection and pickup:

1546
02:16:34,006 --> 02:16:43,006
6-6-7-0-0,
6-5-4-0-6,

1547
02:16:43,006 --> 02:16:52,672
6-6-7-1-8,
6-6-6-9-4...

1548
02:16:52,672 --> 02:16:55,639
No! She cannot walk!

1549
02:16:55,639 --> 02:16:57,605
Bring her!!

1550
02:16:57,605 --> 02:17:02,173
7-8-9-9-2.

1551
02:17:02,173 --> 02:17:04,439
Died last night!

1552
02:17:04,439 --> 02:17:09,706
6-6-7-3-0.

1553
02:17:12,539 --> 02:17:14,706
Corrie...

1554
02:17:14,706 --> 02:17:18,006
What you said, I want it--

1555
02:17:18,006 --> 02:17:20,139
I want him.

1556
02:17:20,139 --> 02:17:22,839
Then ask.

1557
02:17:22,839 --> 02:17:25,439
I don't know what to ask for.

1558
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:28,139
He knows...
Just ask!

1559
02:17:28,139 --> 02:17:31,273
...7-4-2-8-1.

1560
02:17:33,839 --> 02:17:37,639
7-6-0-3-1.

1561
02:18:15,839 --> 02:18:18,206
Papa...

1562
02:18:20,206 --> 02:18:23,306
Sleep well, Corrie.

1563
02:18:24,339 --> 02:18:26,839
Papa?

1564
02:18:26,839 --> 02:18:28,173
Yes, Corrie.

1565
02:18:28,173 --> 02:18:30,472
What is it like to die?

1566
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:44,372
When you and I go to Amsterdam,

1567
02:18:44,372 --> 02:18:47,039
when do I give you your ticket?

1568
02:18:47,039 --> 02:18:49,139
Just before we get on the train.

1569
02:18:49,139 --> 02:18:51,273
So with death.

1570
02:18:51,273 --> 02:18:53,073
When the time comes,

1571
02:18:53,073 --> 02:18:55,073
our wise Heavenly Father

1572
02:18:55,073 --> 02:18:58,439
will give you all the strength you need.

1573
02:19:11,339 --> 02:19:14,639
Prisoner 66730,

1574
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:17,872
Ten Boom, Cornelia.

1575
02:19:20,139 --> 02:19:23,772
Ten Boom, Cornelia.

1576
02:19:34,139 --> 02:19:39,306
Sentence completed,
21st, 12, 44.

1577
02:19:39,306 --> 02:19:41,405
Sign.

1578
02:19:43,239 --> 02:19:45,039
What is it?

1579
02:19:45,039 --> 02:19:47,806
Prisoner certifies that all treatment
received during her imprisonment

1580
02:19:47,806 --> 02:19:51,672
has been adequate and humane
and that no accidents,

1581
02:19:51,672 --> 02:19:54,605
illnesses, or injuries have occurred.

1582
02:19:54,605 --> 02:19:57,306
Sign.

1583
02:20:25,505 --> 02:20:29,039
Kommen zie fraulien,
kommen zie!

1584
02:21:05,073 --> 02:21:10,539
You know, Corrie,
we are going to be free

1585
02:21:10,539 --> 02:21:14,306
before the new year.

1586
02:21:14,306 --> 02:21:18,539
We will...
I know it!

1587
02:22:29,539 --> 02:22:32,806
Years later it was learned

1588
02:22:32,806 --> 02:22:37,106
my release came through
a clerical error.

1589
02:22:37,106 --> 02:22:39,972
What some might call a "mistake."

1590
02:22:39,972 --> 02:22:44,006
Not long after I was set free,

1591
02:22:44,006 --> 02:22:47,939
women my age were put to death.

1592
02:22:47,939 --> 02:22:52,672
Yes...
I am Corrie Ten Boom,

1593
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:55,672
in my 80s now.

1594
02:22:57,672 --> 02:23:01,173
Some questions remain,

1595
02:23:01,173 --> 02:23:03,806
but they are not to be feared.

1596
02:23:03,806 --> 02:23:08,472
Our Heavenly Father holds
all things in His hands,

1597
02:23:08,472 --> 02:23:12,306
even our questions.

1598
02:23:15,006 --> 02:23:19,206
As for myself,
in the years since Ravensbruck,

1599
02:23:19,206 --> 02:23:23,539
the Lord has sent me to some 60 countries.

1600
02:23:23,539 --> 02:23:29,206
And I have told to
anyone who would listen:

1601
02:23:29,206 --> 02:23:33,605
"No pit is so deep...

1602
02:23:33,605 --> 02:23:38,173
That He is not deeper still."

1603
02:23:38,173 --> 02:23:44,039
With Jesus...
Even in our darkest moments,

1604
02:23:44,039 --> 02:23:47,572
the best remains...

1605
02:23:47,572 --> 02:23:52,539
And the very best is yet to be!

1606
02:23:52,539 --> 02:23:57,839
I promised my sister I would tell it...

1607
02:23:57,839 --> 02:24:00,706
And I tell you!
