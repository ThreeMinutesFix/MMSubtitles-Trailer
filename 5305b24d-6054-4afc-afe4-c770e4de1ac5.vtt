WEBVTT

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.091
I've got just about
enough fuel to get back, Pete!

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.563
Un-be-lievable, man!

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.632
You think we're the first
to see that, Nate!?

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.756
They're just not gonna believe this.

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:55.390
5-6 Henry to Shell Mera.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.022
Flying in to Arajuno Station.

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.497
'Back within the hour.

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:00.031
Copy that 5-6 Henry.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.099
Weather clear.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.927
See you soon. Over.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.464
God can do anything,
anything, anything...!

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.692
A what!?

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.027
A clearing, Jim...
it was amazing...

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.497
Tell'em, Pete!

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:17.895
Several large houses...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.057
and about six smaller ones
all around it.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.427
An Auca settlement--

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.691
the Indian tribe
we've been trying to find!

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.197
Where did you say it was?

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.163
By the banks
of the Curaray, Ed.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:31.255
It's 15 minutes
by plane... 20 at most!

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:32.923
But that's just
right here!

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.589
I say we make
contact with them!

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:35.756
Wait guys...

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.889
the Auca's have killed anyone

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.364
that's ever been near them.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:40.932
Remember the Oil
company people...

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.056
just, what...
a couple of years ago?

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:45.996
Four men surveying...

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.089
after weeks of being
in the same area...

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.955
Speared-- All of them!

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:30.260
I say go slow...
one step at a time.

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:34.163
I agree with Pete--
we make contact, but slowly.

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:36.095
I know the risk fellas'...

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.665
but man, the opportunity!

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:40.289
These people have never
ever had the gospel!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.025
An unreached tribe!

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.326
I say...

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:45.898
"with God nothing
shall be impossible"

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.898
And I say we keep this
to ourselves.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.296
We speak about it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.059
and it's likely to get out of hand--

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.428
we may never have another
opportunity like this.

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:54.623
Hush-hush

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:55.960
Except our wives.

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:58.396
Other than that
not a word to anyone.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.057
And if it be our loss...
may it be to God's glory.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:04.462
And the Auca's salvation!

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:05.998
Iím in!

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.032
Operation Auca-- Yeah!

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.062
It's beautiful.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.496
Quiet...

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.157
Peaceful...

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:49.663
lt always is up here.

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:51.959
lt was not always like this.

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.998
No.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.089
There was a time when
we lived... in fear....

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.428
Fear?

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:02.623
Ah yes...

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:04.995
Fear of the foreigners,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.725
fear of even of those
in our own tribe.

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:12.095
A time when we were killed

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.190
and when we also killed...
a time of darkness.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.198
Before they came...

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.890
Jim?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.829
Yes, Jim...

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:27.763
and Nate and Pete,
Ed and Roger...

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:31.321
The men God sent
to show us His ways.

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:35.160
God had put it in their
hearts to search for us.

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:53.021
Okay.

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:54.723
Face off, you guys.

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:57.425
Stay on your toes...
circle-circle.

00:04:57.533 --> 00:04:59.862
Don't get too close
to the edge there!

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:02.421
Ha ha!

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:03.896
Outta shape, Elliot!

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.296
Arr...

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.195
Not a chance, McCully.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.163
Yeah!

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.856
Good move! Alright!

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.092
Urh...

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.098
Hey guys!

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.291
Oooohhh!

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.491
So who's blue trunks?

00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:22.524
Jim Elliot?

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:23.826
Huh!

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:26.797
Believe me, honey--
you're wasting your time!

00:05:27.866 --> 00:05:28.854
Here we go!

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:30.591
Keep moving! Keep moving!

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.724
So, you won

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.163
the national public
speaking contest, huh?

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:37.289
You think you're just
the greatest stuff,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.990
don't ya McCully?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.622
You got a lotta talent huh?

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:43.529
Where'd you think you
got that from... hmm?

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:45.690
Iíll tell you where you got it!

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:47.628
Get off of'a me you...

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:49.562
God gave it to you McCully...

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.098
So what're you gonna do with it,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.563
make money for yourself?

00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:53.927
Huh?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.790
You oughta be a missionary, Ed!

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.956
And Iím praying
God makes you one!

00:06:01.933 --> 00:06:04.161
Okay, Jim...

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:05.697
you made your point!

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:07.924
Oooohhh--
grips' getting' better!

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.329
Ahh...

00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:10.296
Oow!

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.729
That's gotta hurt!

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:13.299
So Jim doesn't date?

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.626
Single!

00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:16.393
One-track, Jim?

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.863
One track mind!

00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:22.399
For the mission field that is!

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.624
He'll be single forever!

00:06:24.733 --> 00:06:26.256
(All - sigh)

00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:27.855
Ugh...

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:29.125
Oow!

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:30.926
Think about
what I said though!

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:32.465
Maybe after law school!

00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:33.827
You become a lawyer

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:35.899
and you'll be doing
what someone else can do...

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.228
but not many people
are answering God's call

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:39.526
to missions...

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:40.860
Think about it, Ed.

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:42.091
Umph!

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:48.161
Then onward from
the hills of light

00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:50.095
our hearts with love aflame

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.063
Will vanquish all
the host of night

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:54.029
in Jesus' conquering name

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:55.497
What time is it?

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:57.065
Almost there...

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.791
Too bad Ed couldn't come
witnessing with us.

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:04.327
Man!

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:06.691
What happened?

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:07.856
Dead.

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:09.023
What!?

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:10.723
Dead! Dead!!

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.231
C'mon.

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:15.594
Swell! C'mon!

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.756
What's that noise?

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:22.792
Aaauuugghhh!!!

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:24.365
C'mon, C'mon!!

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:26.228
Step on the gas!
Step on the gas!!!

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:28.356
...Get out!

00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:30.160
crash

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:32.391
Aaauuugghhh...

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.560
Wow!

00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:38.132
You fellas' alright?

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:39.290
Yeah.

00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:42.925
It's the second time...

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:44.260
What...?

00:07:44.367 --> 00:07:45.627
First time I almost got killed

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:46.858
was on a hunting trip

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.159
when a bullet grazed my head.

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:51.925
God's got something
ready for me yet.

00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:54.363
Dad's gonna kill me!

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:57.433
That's the car we were gonna
take for the mission trip

00:07:57.533 --> 00:07:59.089
to Mexico next week.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.393
Now how are we
gonna get there?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.625
Mexico was a way for Jim
to work for God

00:08:05.733 --> 00:08:07.995
outside of his country
for the first time

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.759
and well...

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:12.355
they found a way
to get there.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.590
Thanks mister!

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:42.361
Noe!

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:16.394
Brilliant, Elliot!

00:09:23.566 --> 00:09:24.464
Goodness,

00:09:24.566 --> 00:09:26.998
he's picked up some
basic Spanish quickly...

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.532
How long has he been here?

00:09:28.633 --> 00:09:29.690
Six weeks!

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.390
Hordes of determination.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.760
'Tell you one thing...

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:35.923
What's that?

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:38.295
Jim Elliot's
a resolute young man.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.263
That boy's going places.

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:43.857
India!?

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:45.932
You want to go
to India!?

00:09:46.033 --> 00:09:47.192
Or South America.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.528
Iím really
not sure!

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:52.031
After being here...
I...

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.758
Iím thinking that God
may want me to work there...

00:09:54.866 --> 00:09:56.855
A Dr. Tidmarsh and I
have written each other.

00:09:56.966 --> 00:09:59.023
He works with Indians
in Ecuador.

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:01.156
So... Iím praying!

00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.198
Well, you'd make
a great teacher.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.164
Folks could really
use you in the states!

00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:07.391
Maybe...

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.863
but I just don't think it's
what God wants of me, Ron.

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.262
Folks in the US
have it all the time--

00:10:13.367 --> 00:10:14.764
almost too much!

00:10:14.866 --> 00:10:17.889
What Iíd really like to do
is work with people

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.558
that have never heard
the gospel.

00:10:20.666 --> 00:10:23.826
I feel God is calling me...

00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:25.865
To leave everything?

00:10:25.966 --> 00:10:27.829
Home... country...

00:10:27.933 --> 00:10:30.399
Once you go,
you may never come back.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.760
Are you sure?

00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:32.763
Sure?

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:33.923
Not yet...

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:36.363
But one thing,
I am sure of Ron,

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:40.592
is that he is no fool who
gives what he cannot keep

00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:44.427
to gain what
he cannot lose.

00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:47.930
He'll make the way clear
when the time comes.

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:50.794
Look at that Ron.

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:52.797
Here we are,
you and I,

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:54.990
just abounding in
God's goodness

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.964
and looking up at that
fantastic sight

00:10:58.066 --> 00:11:00.793
and somewhere in
some part of the world

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:03.263
that same moon is
shining down on someone

00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:05.764
who knows nothing
about Him...

00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:19.555
Maybe someone that has never
even heard about God--

00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:23.531
someone who doesn't
even imagine a god.

00:11:43.866 --> 00:11:47.821
Wherever that person is,
that's where I want to go!

00:12:00.866 --> 00:12:02.832
The poor thing is trembling!

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.731
I can't understand
a word she's saying!

00:12:10.033 --> 00:12:11.397
Found her here
this morning, you say?

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.863
Si, Senor. An Auca.

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:14.057
Auca!?

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.496
That tribe is so savage,

00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:17.225
they're feared by
all the others!

00:12:17.333 --> 00:12:19.458
We've never been able to make
any sort of contact...

00:12:19.566 --> 00:12:21.657
Of the friendly kind,
you mean...

00:12:21.766 --> 00:12:23.426
she seems to have
run away..

00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:25.862
Yes... well she's
terribly frightened

00:12:25.966 --> 00:12:28.091
to whatever was
the cause, poor girl!

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.393
Dr. Tidmarsh will be
very interested.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.125
And how is
the good doctor?

00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:33.721
Oh, busy as usual.

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:35.356
They left for Shandia
this morning.

00:12:35.467 --> 00:12:37.092
Which is where Iíd
better start heading!

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.496
Senor!

00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:40.065
Very kind, Don Carlos!

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:42.223
My pleasure!

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.793
Senor...

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.389
Dr. Tidmarsh--

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.590
there has been
an accident!

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:52.887
Hmmmm!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.761
A letter
from Dr. Tidmarsh.

00:12:55.866 --> 00:12:57.764
My dear Jim,

00:12:57.866 --> 00:13:00.593
I need to know if you
are seriously contemplating

00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:01.926
coming to Ecuador.

00:13:02.033 --> 00:13:04.397
As we recently suffered
a set-back.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.761
Having boarded
a missionary plane

00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:08.162
to return to our base,

00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:11.789
it crashed not long after,
and my wife was injured.

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:15.195
We can no longer care
for the work we began.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.629
And we need someone
to come and work among

00:13:17.733 --> 00:13:20.824
the Quechuas
and reopen Shandia.

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.899
Ecuador!

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.897
Dear Dr. Tidmarsh...

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.591
I am on my way!

00:13:33.266 --> 00:13:35.925
My dear Jim,
wonderful news!

00:13:36.033 --> 00:13:39.590
I hope you and your friend,
Pete Flemming, like water!

00:13:39.699 --> 00:13:42.995
You'll be at sea
about 20 days.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.089
And I am sure
that upon arrival,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.791
Quito will seem
another world to you.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.032
Fresh plantains!
Good price!

00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:57.031
Newspaper...

00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:59.190
get your newspaper!

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.398
My name is Jim.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.057
Now you'll have to learn
the basics of Spanish first,

00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:06.927
about six months
of study,

00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:08.794
which you'll do
in the Capitol.

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:10.388
Not here!

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.624
I need to go
to Central P.O.--

00:14:12.733 --> 00:14:14.256
further ahead.

00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:15.764
Alright sir!

00:14:15.866 --> 00:14:18.389
You should have told me.
We're on our way.

00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:21.657
And then you'll
be ready for...

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:25.696
Shandia!

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:34.591
lt will need rebuilding.

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:36.597
And I will not
stay there long.

00:14:36.699 --> 00:14:38.995
You will need
to learn Quechua,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.032
tend to basic needs,
clear land for an airstrip.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:47.361
If Quito seems like
a different world,

00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:50.456
Shandia will be
a different universe!

00:14:52.733 --> 00:14:54.359
And be sure, Jim,

00:14:54.467 --> 00:14:56.728
that as you are
obedient to God,

00:14:56.833 --> 00:14:58.799
there will be tests.

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:00.797
Many tests.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.763
Quickly! Run!

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.257
Saturday,
August 1 , 1 953--

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:09.696
They say it was

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:12.765
the worst rainy
season in 30 years.

00:16:12.866 --> 00:16:15.627
For 36 hours
we dismantled the house

00:16:15.733 --> 00:16:18.256
and moved barrels
of material non-stop.

00:16:19.966 --> 00:16:23.160
Our language notes,
five buildings,

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:25.232
the kids playing field,

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:27.855
a hundred meters
of airstrip...

00:16:27.966 --> 00:16:29.296
a year's work--

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.025
Gone!

00:16:31.133 --> 00:16:35.588
I knew there would be tests
but hardly anything like this!

00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:39.132
It's hard to understand
what God is doing...

00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:41.358
Shandia is no more.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.796
ln the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.790
Thank you Lord!

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:11.696
A time of reaping!

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:12.696
Yes!

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.095
ln the last two weeks

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.132
they've just been
so open to the Word--

00:17:16.233 --> 00:17:18.028
20 in Dos Rios, Pano the same--

00:17:18.133 --> 00:17:20.258
and here in Shandia,
about a dozen more.

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:23.026
It's amazing what God's done
in one year, isn't it?

00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:25.531
Like getting McCully
to the mission field!

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:26.656
Uh huh!

00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:28.755
And one track Jim
getting married!

00:17:28.866 --> 00:17:31.696
Miracle of miracles!

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:33.356
Pete-- honey!

00:17:33.467 --> 00:17:34.762
And there's my miracle!

00:17:34.866 --> 00:17:36.264
Coming, hon!

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:42.156
Not your usual church, eh?

00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:43.993
But a live one!

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.328
Isn't that the truth, Ed.

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.058
Isn't that the truth.

00:17:48.166 --> 00:17:49.462
Okay folks get ready!

00:17:49.533 --> 00:17:50.430
Hon!

00:17:50.533 --> 00:17:52.328
C'mon squeeze in a little...

00:17:52.433 --> 00:17:53.490
Daddy!

00:17:53.599 --> 00:17:54.860
Okay! C'mon! C'mon!

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:56.398
Pose and...

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.022
Smile!

00:17:59.733 --> 00:18:01.596
So, Jim wasn't alone?

00:18:01.699 --> 00:18:03.131
Oh no...

00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:05.790
God called others
who were serving Him.

00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:07.797
Jim prayed for help.

00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:09.365
God sent it.

00:18:09.467 --> 00:18:11.490
God had a plan.

00:18:16.367 --> 00:18:18.265
Nothing here.

00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:19.662
Hang on...

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:20.663
What!?

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.823
Hang on!

00:18:21.933 --> 00:18:23.660
Aauuughhhh!!

00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:25.198
What was that
all about!?

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.095
Over there...
I think... Yeah...

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.257
Look!

00:18:28.367 --> 00:18:30.162
Where, where, where...?

00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:31.925
Oh my goodness!!!
Oh my goodness!!!

00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:33.726
They're just not
gonna believe this!

00:18:33.833 --> 00:18:35.265
Whoo!!!

00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:38.299
I've got just about
enough fuel to get back, Pete!

00:18:41.133 --> 00:18:42.655
It's Auca alright!

00:18:42.766 --> 00:18:45.289
I don't know how we
never saw it before!

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.525
You know what?

00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:48.463
This is what it's all about.

00:18:48.567 --> 00:18:50.623
I feel as though this
is what God has been

00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:53.199
leading me to
all these years.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.857
I say we attempt
communications.

00:18:55.966 --> 00:18:57.693
Sounds good... how?

00:18:57.799 --> 00:19:00.027
Weekly flights.

00:19:00.133 --> 00:19:01.156
With gifts--

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.731
we can drop them
in a basket,

00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:04.594
just like we do
for other missionaries.

00:19:04.699 --> 00:19:05.995
And some phrases.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.690
ln Auca? How?

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:10.425
Daiyuma, the Auca girl
that escaped her tribe.

00:19:12.533 --> 00:19:14.556
Never met her, but
have heard about her.

00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:16.064
You guys go for the flights.

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:17.631
Iíll get some phrases,

00:19:17.733 --> 00:19:20.063
so we can show them
that we're friendly.

00:19:21.333 --> 00:19:22.560
See anything?

00:19:24.966 --> 00:19:26.125
Not yet.

00:19:27.899 --> 00:19:30.626
They're there...
just a matter of time.

00:19:39.699 --> 00:19:43.325
Bito emite waa ponemo...

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:46.796
We are your friends.

00:19:46.899 --> 00:19:49.729
Thank you, Daiyuma.
You've been very helpful.

00:19:49.833 --> 00:19:51.992
You want to meet them?

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.464
We want to try, Daiyuma.

00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:57.623
Do not trust them.

00:19:57.733 --> 00:20:00.597
They will appear friendly...

00:20:02.966 --> 00:20:03.954
and then...

00:20:04.066 --> 00:20:05.895
Then!?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.057
...they kill.

00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:12.357
The men were patient

00:20:12.467 --> 00:20:15.262
and persistent
at the same time.

00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:19.890
They prayed...their wives prayed...

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.660
We... we were afraid--
and hid until one day...

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:35.326
Let me try calling again.

00:20:54.899 --> 00:20:56.990
Praise God! There's one!

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:09.126
What are they doing?

00:21:09.233 --> 00:21:10.926
They got it, Nate!

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:12.397
Ha! Ha!

00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:17.996
We're getting a gift!

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.430
Ha! Ha! Ha!

00:21:19.533 --> 00:21:21.192
Whohooo! Yes!

00:21:22.933 --> 00:21:25.126
Praise God!

00:21:25.233 --> 00:21:27.358
Time to plan the next step!

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.398
So we're in agreement--

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.965
Roger Youdarian joins the team.

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:43.259
We trust your judgment, Nate.

00:21:43.367 --> 00:21:44.992
He's got experience--

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.759
he's a lot more jungle savvy
than the rest of us!

00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:49.593
Okay, so January 3rd--

00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:53.154
you fly us in one at a time
with the prefab tree house.

00:21:53.266 --> 00:21:55.027
Ed, Roger and I stay,

00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:57.065
and you and Pete fly back

00:21:57.166 --> 00:22:00.326
to meet us in the morning
and out again in the evening.

00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:01.796
And we use the radio

00:22:01.899 --> 00:22:03.559
to stay in contact
with our families.

00:22:03.666 --> 00:22:04.893
Hi, Daddy!

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.432
Speaking of which!!

00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:07.691
Ha, ha! Woo!

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:09.425
Supper's ready guys!

00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:11.896
Jim, Iím frightened!

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.262
Don't worry.
We're in God's hands.

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:16.355
What if--

00:22:16.467 --> 00:22:18.796
Honey, all my life
I've tried to be obedient

00:22:18.899 --> 00:22:20.762
to what God has
called me to do.

00:22:20.866 --> 00:22:23.696
We can't stop now
just because there's a bit

00:22:23.799 --> 00:22:25.662
of danger involved.

00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:28.755
I know, but you won't
do anything silly, will you?

00:22:28.866 --> 00:22:30.332
I promise.

00:23:12.033 --> 00:23:13.692
Try it again, Pete!

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.361
Oh my...

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:30.832
Whooooaa...
slow down Jim!

00:23:30.933 --> 00:23:33.422
Slow down.

00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:06.094
Pete! Pete!

00:24:10.433 --> 00:24:12.296
Roger! Ro-ger!

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.797
You?

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:26.690
Praise God! This is great!

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.060
Nate, you getting' this?

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:29.291
Nate!

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.457
Huh? What?!

00:24:30.567 --> 00:24:32.032
Are you gettin' this?

00:24:32.133 --> 00:24:33.531
Oh yeah... sure!

00:24:38.633 --> 00:24:40.792
Thank You, Lord!
Thank You!

00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:46.395
Ed! Hey Ed!

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.466
Huh?

00:24:47.567 --> 00:24:49.328
Show'em the cockpit.

00:24:49.433 --> 00:24:50.864
Okay-- Sure!

00:24:55.733 --> 00:24:57.131
Hey, Pete!

00:24:57.233 --> 00:24:58.467
What's up!?

00:24:58.467 --> 00:25:00.365
Let's tell them about
the landing strip.

00:25:00.467 --> 00:25:01.932
We can't keep using this one.

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:02.999
It's too sandy!

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.294
So plane lands...
swooooshhhhhh!

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.389
Ouch! Boom! Bang!
Hits the trees!

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.965
Nooooooo!

00:25:11.066 --> 00:25:13.294
Trees out of the way!

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.592
Swooosh!

00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:17.495
See? Good landing!

00:25:18.833 --> 00:25:20.459
Way to go!

00:25:20.567 --> 00:25:22.465
Ha, ha, ha!

00:25:39.433 --> 00:25:42.558
ls he saying what
I think he's saying?

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.791
I think he is.

00:26:12.033 --> 00:26:14.999
lt was a special day
for the missionaries--

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.759
a day they and their families
had been praying for.

00:26:18.866 --> 00:26:21.094
Among them was joy...

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.394
but among our people... fear.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.364
Our new friends
stayed till the evening

00:26:27.467 --> 00:26:29.296
after a full
afternoon's visit.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.729
Pete and I are back
in Arajuno for the night.

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:33.958
We're thrilled with such
an answer to prayer,

00:26:34.066 --> 00:26:36.123
and trust God
for further visits

00:26:36.233 --> 00:26:37.529
in the next few days.

00:26:37.633 --> 00:26:38.826
God bless you there.

00:26:38.933 --> 00:26:40.058
Over.

00:26:40.166 --> 00:26:42.064
Well we're so relieved
to know that all went well

00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:43.530
and that you're safe.

00:26:43.633 --> 00:26:45.099
You are certainly
in our prayers

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.790
and we look forward
to more good news.

00:26:46.899 --> 00:26:48.728
I love you honey!
Good night.

00:26:58.533 --> 00:26:59.998
Two days and no movement!

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.362
If they don't come out
here in five minutes,

00:27:02.467 --> 00:27:04.092
Iím heading out to their village!

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.427
Hold your horses, Jim!

00:27:05.533 --> 00:27:07.123
Give'em time!

00:27:07.233 --> 00:27:10.926
Wait a sec...
I see something!

00:27:15.866 --> 00:27:18.264
Let's see what we have here...

00:27:24.866 --> 00:27:27.957
Woohoo!!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

00:27:28.066 --> 00:27:29.396
Get ready boys!

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.897
They're on their way!

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.364
Alright fellas'...
let's get a move on!

00:27:34.467 --> 00:27:36.659
We got company!

00:27:38.966 --> 00:27:41.558
Thank You, Lord!
Finally! Finally!

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:46.262
Looks like our neighbors
will be here

00:27:46.367 --> 00:27:47.855
for the early
afternoon service!

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.829
Iíll get right back
in touch you with you at 4:30!

00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:50.899
Over!

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.296
That's wonderful!
We'll be standing by.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.366
ln the meantime,

00:27:54.467 --> 00:27:55.524
you are all
in our prayers!

00:27:55.633 --> 00:27:56.963
Over and out!

00:28:01.467 --> 00:28:03.160
Can I say hi
to daddy?

00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:05.896
Oh, sweetie!

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.829
He'll call back
at 4:30!

00:28:07.933 --> 00:28:09.365
Hi, daddy!

00:28:11.133 --> 00:28:13.792
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!

00:28:13.899 --> 00:28:17.127
Oh glorious victory
that overcomes the world!

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.022
Whoahhh!

00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:31.359
Hallelujah guys!

00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:33.365
This is the day
we've been waitin' for!!

00:28:33.467 --> 00:28:34.762
How many coming?

00:28:34.866 --> 00:28:37.264
Seven-- maybe ten
at the most.

00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:39.356
Sounds like a welcoming
committee to me.

00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:41.659
I wonder if we'll go
to their village today?

00:28:41.766 --> 00:28:43.789
Nate, your camera!

00:28:43.899 --> 00:28:45.626
Got it right here!

00:28:45.733 --> 00:28:48.222
Well... this is it!

00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:50.128
Rog, what are you doing?

00:28:50.233 --> 00:28:52.790
Taking notes, man--
this is historic!

00:28:52.899 --> 00:28:54.694
What time is it?

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:57.061
Uh... 3:05!

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:05.731
They're here!
Welcome! Welcome!

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.863
And if it's our loss
may it be to God's glory!

00:29:43.966 --> 00:29:45.557
AUUUGH!

00:29:45.666 --> 00:29:48.292
Jim!

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.264
NO! NO!
Augggh!

00:29:51.367 --> 00:29:54.662
And the Aucas salvation.

00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:58.596
Stop! Stop!

00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:02.296
AUUUGH!

00:30:07.766 --> 00:30:11.630
We're friends! Stop!!

00:30:17.966 --> 00:30:19.898
5-6 Henry!
Come in Shell Mera!

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.193
5-6 Henry!
Come in Shell...

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.266
Aaauuuggghhh!

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.830
He is no fool who gives
what he cannot keep

00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:37.626
to gain what
he cannot lose.

00:30:37.733 --> 00:30:39.961
Shell Mera calling 5-6 Henry--

00:30:40.066 --> 00:30:41.656
come in 5-6 Henry.

00:30:41.766 --> 00:30:43.629
Shell Mera calling 5-6 Henry--

00:30:43.733 --> 00:30:45.756
come in 5-6 Henry.

00:30:53.133 --> 00:30:55.463
But why were they killed?

00:30:55.567 --> 00:30:57.725
We were afraid...

00:30:57.833 --> 00:31:01.697
we thought they had come
to trick us and kill us--

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:05.027
so we did what we had
grown accustomed to...

00:31:05.133 --> 00:31:08.099
we ended their lives.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.961
Later... years later...

00:31:11.066 --> 00:31:13.964
we found out
they had weapons...

00:31:14.066 --> 00:31:16.827
but they did not
fire on us...

00:31:16.933 --> 00:31:18.956
they did not fire...

00:31:19.066 --> 00:31:22.464
When Daiyuma later
returned to our tribe,

00:31:22.567 --> 00:31:24.964
she told us more
about the men

00:31:25.066 --> 00:31:27.964
and why they had come
to visit us.

00:31:28.066 --> 00:31:31.294
We realized then,
that unlike others,

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.695
they had not harmed us

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:37.288
even when they had guns
and could have.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.957
They were different
from the other foreigners.

00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:43.827
We had watched them
from afar.

00:31:43.933 --> 00:31:47.831
Later we understood
love and forgiveness--

00:31:47.933 --> 00:31:51.457
for they gave their lives
willingly for us,

00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:54.930
just as Jesus did
before them.

00:31:55.033 --> 00:31:57.022
A few months later,

00:31:57.133 --> 00:31:59.361
Jim Elliot's wife, Elisabeth,

00:31:59.467 --> 00:32:01.399
and their daughter, Valerie,

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.057
and Nate Saint's sister, Rachel,

00:32:04.166 --> 00:32:07.223
bravely came to our village.

00:32:07.333 --> 00:32:10.356
They forgave us,

00:32:10.467 --> 00:32:14.524
and through their forgiveness
we learned to forgive.

00:32:14.633 --> 00:32:17.861
And through their love,
we learned to love.

00:32:17.966 --> 00:32:20.364
Through their
courage and prayers...

00:32:20.467 --> 00:32:23.490
we came to know God.

00:32:23.599 --> 00:32:25.758
Five men died,

00:32:25.866 --> 00:32:28.094
five women
and their families

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.029
forgave us.

00:32:30.133 --> 00:32:31.758
Some of us--

00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:36.026
including some of us
that had killed the men,

00:32:36.133 --> 00:32:39.429
found God
and became Christians.

00:32:39.533 --> 00:32:43.897
Because they were obedient
to the God they loved

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.659
and brought His light
to our people.

00:32:56.733 --> 00:32:59.599
Elisabeth Elliot and her daughter
Valerie,

00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:03.000
lived and worked among the Aucas
for two years

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.799
later to become a
well-known author, Marilou McCully
set up a home

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:14.533
for missionary children in Quito.
Olive Flemming returned to
the United States

00:33:14.533 --> 00:33:17.000
and also wrote her
account of the story.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Barbara Youderian returnedto work
among the Jivaros,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.966
where she and Roger had
previously labored.

00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:27.500
Marj Saint took up a new missionary
post in Quito,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.125
and Rachel Saint,
Nate's sister,

00:33:30.666 --> 00:33:35.200
remained with the Auca'suntil her
death in 1 994.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.496
No longer known as Aucas--

00:33:37.733 --> 00:33:40.066
the Quechua word for "savage,"

00:33:40.066 --> 00:33:42.294
the tribe is now known
by their real name--

00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:44.160
the Waoranis.

00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:46.827
Steve Saint, Nate's son,

00:33:46.966 --> 00:33:51.921
continues work among the Waorani
to this day.
