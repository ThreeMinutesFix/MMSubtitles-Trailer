00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,090
Tony, you should go see her practice
tomorrow. She's really very good.

153
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm out of town this week.

154
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,930
When were you gonna tell me?

155
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,220
I just did.

156
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,850
Tony, I know you're
the company's top salesman,

157
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,030
but in order for this family to function,
we have to communicate.

158
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,110
I thought you'd be here this week.

159
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,780
Well, if you want to continue to live
in this house, I have to make sales.

160
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,740
And that means being flexible.

161
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,540
Aren't you a little too old
to be jumping rope?

162
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,210
<font color="#80FF00">(SIGHS)</font>

163
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,670
<font color="#ffff00">CLARA</font>: Here you go.

164
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,800
Now there's 5, 10, 15, 20.

165
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,260
And here's 5 extra 'cause
I like your haircut.

166
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,510
Thank you, Ms. Williams.

167
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,070
I'm tired of seeing all these young boys
with sloppy hair

168
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,860
and pants around their knees.

169
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,160
- A man wears his pants around his waist.
- Yes, ma'am.

170
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,330
Well, tell your mama I said hello.
And I'll see you next week.

171
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,570
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

172
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,410
Ms. Williams?

173
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
That's me.

174
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,790
You must be Elizabeth.

175
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,740
Well, it's so good to meet you.

176
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,450
You can call me Clara.

177
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,130
Well, come on in.
Let me show you the house.

178
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,550
I got to put my coffee pot on.
Can I get you something?

179
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,630
Oh, no, thank you. I had mine at home.

180
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,420
This is a beautiful house.

181
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,390
<font color="#ffff00">CLARA</font>: I think so, too.

182
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,770
Built in 1905.

183
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,310
And I've lived here almost 50 years.

184
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,440
Leo added that sun porch on the back
all by himself.

185
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,310
Oh, this must be Leo.

186
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,240
That's Leo.

187
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,280
We were married for 14
years before he died.

188
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,330
He had just been promoted to captain
before that picture was taken.

189
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,370
He was so handsome in that uniform.

190
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,120
He's fine, ain't he?

191
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,380
<font color="#80FF00">(LAUGHS)</font>

192
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,550
Yes, we wanted five or six children,

193
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,050
but the Lord only gave us Clyde,
'cause he was all I could handle.

194
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,100
You see that big crack
over there on the wall?

195
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,680
That was Clyde.

196
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,430
Now, this is my third favorite place.

197
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,140
It's my sitting room.

198
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,890
- Hmm. What do you do in here?
- Mainly sit.

199
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,190
Well, come on in here.
Let me show you the dining room.

200
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,950
Now this is my second favorite place.

201
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,700
I love this room.

202
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,630
This is beautiful.

203
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,170
- And I love this fireplace.
- <font color="#80FF00">(SIGHS)</font>

204
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,130
I've got a lot of good memories in here.

205
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,670
Yes, I do.

206
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,090
Lot of laughter.

207
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,460
And a few tears, too.

208
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,310
Now this is why I'm moving in with Clyde
a few blocks away. Ooh!

209
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,690
It's getting harder to
negotiate these stairs.

210
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,030
Okay, so three bedrooms and two full baths.

211
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,900
- Do you mind if I take some pictures?
- Oh, go ahead, that's fine.

212
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,190
Oh, you got one of those smart phones.

213
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,070
I've been meaning to get me one of those.

214
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,120
Can't do nothing with my phone
but call folks.

215
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,700
Must be a dumb phone.

216
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,460
- You got it?
- I do.

217
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,790
They say if you live in a house
with stairs, you'll live longer.

218
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,090
So I should make it to 180.

219
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,380
This is fascinating, Ms. Clara.

220
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,550
<font color="#ffff00">CLARA</font>: Oh, that's my Wall of Remembrance.

221
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,430
And when things aren't going so well,
I look back on it,

222
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,770
and I'm reminded that God
is still in control.

223
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,020
It encourages me.

224
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,020
I sure could use some of that.

225
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,230
Oh. <font color="#80FF00">(CHUCKLES)</font> I'm sorry.

226
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Okay. So, I've got
a few questions about utilities,

227
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,160
and then we should probably talk
about the asking price.

228
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,280
All right.

229
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,330
Okay. So, I think I got everything
that I need for now.

230
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,910
So nice to meet you, Ms. Clara.

231
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,380
Listen, if you're available tomorrow,

232
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,170
I'd like to come by and show you
some comparisons in the area.

233
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,300
Well, why don't you come by for coffee
tomorrow morning

234
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,720
and we'll talk about it then? Say 10:00?

235
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,390
Ah. Okay. Yeah, I can do that.
I'll see you at 10:00.

236
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,940
By the way, what's your most favorite room?

237
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,520
I'll tell you tomorrow.

238
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,110
Then I look forward to tomorrow.

239
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,110
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
<font color="#ffff00">TONY</font>: How you doing?

241
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,610
- Mr. Jordan?
- Yes.

242
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,930
- Samples closet?
- Yes, please.

243
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,790
- Right this way.
- All right.

244
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,040
You can just use the third shelf down
and just leave the door open,

245
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,560
- and I'll come back and get it later.
- All right. Thank you.

246
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,230
You must be Mr. Jordan.

247
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,730
Dr. Morris, yes. I'm Tony Jordan,
Brightwell Pharmaceuticals.

248
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,900
We met last March.

249
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,270
- I remember. How are you?
- I'm doing fine.

250
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,450
I saw your write-up on new stimulants
and you showed interest in Predizim.

251
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,450
So I just left you a case
in your samples closet.

252
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,200
Oh, that's fantastic. I appreciate that.

253
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,540
Oh, it's no problem.
You'll easily find them.

254
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,180
It's the third shelf, blue caps.

255
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,330
Now what I need you to do though,
is just sign this receipt.

256
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,750
And it just shows that
I left them with you.

257
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,110
Now, Dr. Morris, if you need any more,
you just let me know

258
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,600
and I'll be glad to bring some over.

259
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,090
Thank you, Tony. We'll try them out.

260
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,170
All right. Sounds good.
We'll see you again.

261
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,690
Right.

262
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,220
And I'll be looking forward
to that next article.

263
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,640
<font color="#ffff00">DR. MORRIS</font>: <font color="#80FF00">(LAUGHING)</font> Thank you.

264
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,930
<font color="#ffff00">ELIZABETH</font>: And he thinks
it's my sister's fault.

265
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,560
Can you even believe that?

266
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,140
Well, if my man said that to me,
I'd be angry, too.

267
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,100
We don't fight that much anymore.

268
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,150
After 31 years of stalemates, girl,
it just is not worth it.

269
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,650
Oh, I wouldn't put up with it.

270
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,230
His money became your money
the minute he said, "I do."

271
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,700
So I'd give it to my sister anyway.

272
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,530
I don't even like my sister.

273
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,700
<font color="#ffff00">MANDY</font>: Just be careful, Elizabeth.

274
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,980
You do not want World War Ill
to break out in your home.

275
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,700
No. No, I don't.

276
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,380
But there are days, Mandy. There are days.

277
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,920
It's hard to submit to a man like that.

278
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
You know what my mama used to say to me?

279
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,550
She used to say that sometimes submission
is learning to duck

280
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,880
so God can hit your husband.

00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,050
<font color="#80FF00">(EXHALES)</font> You got that right.

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,080
Veronica, this is Tony Jordan.

285
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,330
We met a few days ago
after I met with Mr. Barnes.

286
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,750
Hey, listen, uh, I'll be coming
through town next week

287
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,050
and I was wondering if you could
recommend a couple of nice restaurants.

288
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,880
Feel free to call me back at this number.

289
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,630
Take care.

290
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,060
<font color="#ffff00">CLARA</font>: I appreciate you coming
this morning.

291
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,890
Coffee will be ready
in a couple of minutes.

292
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,050
Oh, sounds good.

293
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,070
I ran a sales report from the area.

294
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,110
I wrote down a suggested asking price
for the house.

295
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,610
<font color="#ffff00">CLARA</font>: Mmm-hmm.

296
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,900
Well, what do you think?

297
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,580
Mmm-hmm.

298
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,160
Now, what did you say
your husband did for a living?

299
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,790
Um, well, we actually haven't talked
about that,

300
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,960
but he's a sales rep
for Brightwell Pharmaceuticals.

301
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,460
<font color="#ffff00">CLARA</font>: Mmm-hmm.

302
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,630
And where did you say you attended church?

303
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,550
Well, we occasionally attend
Riverdale Community.

304
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,970
<font color="#ffff00">CLARA</font>: Mmm-hmm.

305
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,890
So you would say you know the Lord.

306
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,310
Yes! I would say I know the Lord.

307
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,230
You think the Lord is okay
with this asking price?

308
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,810
<font color="#ffff00">CLARA</font>: Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

And you have children?

310
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,370
Ms. Clara, my husband, Tony, and I
have been married for 16 years.

311
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,740
We have one daughter.
Her name is Danielle and she's 10.

312
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,160
She enjoys pop music and ice cream
and jumping rope.

313
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,540
Oh. Well, that's good to know.

314
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,710
Now, you say
you attend church occasionally.

315
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,590
Is that because your pastor
only preaches occasionally?

316
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,420
Ms. Clara, I really would like to help you
sell your house.

317
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,930
That's why I'm here.

318
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,760
As far as my faith is concerned,
I believe in God, just like most people.

319
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,270
He's very important to me.

320
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,220
Mmm-hmm. Well, let me get our coffee.

321
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,700
So, if I asked you
what your prayer life was like,

322
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,610
would you say that it was hot or cold?

<font color="#80FF00">(CHUCKLES)</font>

324
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,610
I don't know that I would say it's hot.

325
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,000
I mean, we're like most people.
We have full schedules. We work.

326
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,790
But I would consider myself
a spiritual person.

327
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,720
I'm not hot, but I'm not cold either.
Just, you know, somewhere in the middle.

328
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,210
Here you go.

329
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,220
- I've got cream or sugar if you need it.
- Oh, no, thank you. I like it black.

330
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,400
Ms. Clara, you like your coffee
room temperature?

331
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,650
No, baby, mine's hot.

332
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,280
Elizabeth,

333
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,230
people drink their coffee hot or cold,

334
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,200
but nobody likes it lukewarm,
not even the Lord.

335
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,410
Point taken, Ms. Clara.

336
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,990
But why do you feel the need
to examine my personal life?

337
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,750
Because I've been where you are.

338
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,760
And you don't have to step
on the same land mines that I did.

339
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,800
That's a waste of time.

340
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,460
And this asking price is just fine.

I'm sorry?

Just because you argue a lot
doesn't mean that you fight well.

you pray for your husband?

I think it's time for me to show you
my favorite place in this house.

362
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,850
Now, this is where I do my fighting.

363
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,350
A closet?

364
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,770
I call it my war room.

365
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,870
So...

366
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,710
So, you wrote prayers
for each area of your life?

367
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
A prayer strategy. Yes.

368
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,630
Now, I used to do
what you and your husband are doing,

369
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,710
but it got me nowhere.

370
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,930
And then I really started studying
what the scriptures say.

371
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,640
And God showed me that it wasn't my job
to do the heavy lifting. No.

372
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,940
That was something that only He could do.

373
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:00,320
It was my job to seek Him, to trust Him
and to stand on His word.

374
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,830
Ms. Clara, I've never
seen anything like this.

375
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,580
And I admire it, I really do. I just...

376
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,370
I don't have time to pray
that much every day.

377
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,420
But you apparently have time
to fight losing battles with your husband.

378
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,420

379

wound up the more I think about it.

454
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,090
Your thoughts about your husband
are almost entirely negative, aren't they?

455
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,930
He acts like an enemy to me.

456
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,310
See, you're fighting the wrong enemy.

457
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,730
Now, your husband certainly has his issues,
but he's not your enemy.

458
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,200
When I fought against my husband,

459
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,620
I was fighting against my own marriage
and my family.

460
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,370
Now, I tried for years to fix Leo,
but I couldn't do it.

461
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,540
Well, I haven't got anywhere with Tony.

462
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,910
'Cause it's not your job.

463
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:31,510
Who said that it was your responsibility
to fix Tony?

464
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,640
It's your job to love him, to respect him
and to pray for the man.

465
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
God knows he needs it.

466
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,220
And men don't like it when
their woman's always trying to fix them.

467
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,310
Elizabeth,

468
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,150
you got to plead with God
so that He can do what only He can do.

469
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,150
And then you got to get out of the way
and let Him do it!

470
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,490
I don't even know where to start.

471
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,110
Here.

472
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,460
You will find some of my
favorite scriptures in here.

473
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,200
They were my battle plan
to pray for my family.

474
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,210
You can start with that.

475
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,550
<i>Mmm, hey, hey, hey.</i>

476
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,920
<i>Said you been bound up.</i>

477
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,350
<i>Lookin' for a way to break free.</i>

478
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,340
<i>Devil's had you tied up.</i>

479
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,890
<i>Listen to these words from me.</i>

480
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,310
<i>Your situation may seem hopeless.</i>

481
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,270
<i>- But it's not the end.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

482
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,940
<i>Though you are burdened
and have shackles on your feet.</i>

483
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,320
<i>Now, I want you to know
You're about to break loose.</i>

484
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,950
<i>You're about to break loose.</i>

485
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,620
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

486
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,620
<i>Jesus took the keys and gave 'em to you.</i>

487
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,120
<i>So here's what you gotta do.</i>

488
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,170
<i>Shake loose
Everything that binds you up.</i>

489
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,300
<i>Who told you.</i>

490
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,130
<i>Who told you that you can't make it.</i>

491
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,260
<i>When God says that you can shake it
Shake loose.</i>

492
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,930
<i>Everything that binds you up.</i>

493
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,890
<i>- Praise Him like it's your last chance.
- Get up and do the David dance.</i>

494
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,390
<i>Shake yourself loose.</i>

495
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,100

Listen, she just needs one month's rent
and a car payment.

555
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,490
I think we should at least do that.

556
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,240
Cynthia married a loser. Okay?

557
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
That was her choice
when everybody told her not to.

- It is her fault.
- Tony, she cannot control him.

She's got a job, but it's not enough.

In light of all these wrongs,

693
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:10,200
There's love in my heart for Tony, but it's
just buried under a lot of frustration.

694
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,160

- Grace?

00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,280
I don't know that he deserves grace.

696
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,110
Do you deserve grace?

697
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,340
Ms. Clara, you have a habit of backing
me up in a corner and making me squirm.

698
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,160
I felt the same way.

699
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,210
But the question still remains.
Do you deserve grace?

700
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,800
The Bible <i>says</i> that no one is righteous,
not even one.

701
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,600
For we have all sinned.
So, really, none of us deserve grace.

702
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,680
But we all still want God's forgiveness.

703
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,610
Elizabeth, it comes down to this.

704
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,570
Jesus shed his blood on the cross.

705
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,830
He died for you.
Even when you did not deserve it.

706
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,080
And He rose from the grave
and offers forgiveness and salvation

707
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,330
for anyone who turns to Him.

708
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,420
But the Bible also says

709
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,170
that we can't ask Him to forgive us
while refusing to forgive others.

710
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,930
I know, Ms. Clara.
But that's just so hard to do.

711
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,600
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

712
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,180
But that's where grace comes in!

713
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,690
He gives us grace!

714
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,570
And He helps us to give it to others,
even when they don't deserve it.

715
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,160
We all deserve judgment.

716
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:40,040
And that is what a holy God gives us when
we don't repent and believe in His Son.

717
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,550
I had to forgive Leo for some things,
and it wasn't easy.

718
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,370
But it freed me.

719
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:56,010
Elizabeth, there's not room for you
and God on the throne of your heart.

720
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,760
It's either Him or it's you.
You need to step down.

721
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,350
Now, if you want victory,
you're gonna have to first surrender.

722
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,140
But, Ms. Clara,

723
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,650
do I just back off and choose to forgive
and then just let him walk all over me?

724
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,860
God is a good defense attorney.
Trust it to Him.

725
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,030
And then you can turn your focus
to the real enemy.

726
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,540
The real enemy?

727
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,830
The one that wants to remain hidden.

728
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,080
The one that wants to distract you

729
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,380
and deceive you and divide you
from the Lord and your husband!

730
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,430
You see, that's how he works.

731
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:41,020
Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy.

732
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,680
And he is stealing your joy.

733
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,860
He is killing your faith
and he's trying to destroy your family.

734
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,100
If I were you,
I would get my heart right with God.

735
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,700
And you need to do your fighting in prayer!

736
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:04,870
And you need to kick the real enemy
out of your home with the word of God.

737
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,290
It's time for you to fight, Elizabeth.

738
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,630
It's time for you to
fight for your marriage!

739
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,500
It's time for you to fight the real enemy!

740
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,510
It's time for you
to take off the gloves and do it!

<i>There's no magic in the location you pray.</i>

742
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:47,530
<i>But scripture does say to go
into your inner room and pray in secret.</i>

743
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:53,210
<i>And your heavenly Father, who sees

and that you desperately need Him.</i>

You weren't just padding your numbers,

Tony, I've been thinking about your visit.

It's probably all I've thought about
the past two days.

What you did was wrong.

1281

And I was disappointed.

1282
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:17,480
But we've fired salesmen before,
and well, life goes on.

no matter the consequence.

And I kept asking myself, why?

Why would you do that?

The only answer I can come up with

is that you were sincere
in your desire to make it right,

01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:54,260
and that you regret what you've done.

1292
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,480
So I've chosen to believe you.

1293

I can't give you your job back,

When Leo died, we were not on good terms.

1373
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:47,330
I always felt pushed to the back burner while
the military took first place in his life.

1374
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:52,580
And I was... I was bitter, Elizabeth.
I was so bitter.

But even then,
God was showing me what to do.

1376
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,800
He was prompting me to fight for Leo,
to pray for Leo, and I refused.

1377
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:10,180
And I kept pushing it back
and pushing it back until it was too late.

1378
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:18,820
And there's no grief as great
as denying the truth until it's too late.

1379
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:22,320
It was my selfish pride, Elizabeth.

1380

Oh, my selfish pride!

1381
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,830
And I confessed it.

1382
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:37,840
And I repented,
and I begged God to forgive me.

1383

But I still have a scar.

1384
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:47,350
And then I started spending more time
with the Lord,

1385
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,550
and in His word.

1386
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,850
