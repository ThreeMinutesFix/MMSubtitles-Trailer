1
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,600
Hurry father, almost here. And I still haven't 
selected my present and nothing is too good for  

2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,000
my little Adelaide, the daughter of the mayor of 
Frieden and the richest and the most important  

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:07,440
man as well. Oh, well, yes. Oh, good evening, Mr 
Mayor Adelaide. Uh uh uh pastor, let me give you  

4
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,280
a hand with that. Uh uh , thank you. Somehow, it 
seems to get heavier every year. Uh Yes. Well,  

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,720
the nativity scene is an important part of 
our Christmas celebration and we all must do  

6
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:31,120
our part. Even the mayor .Papa. Let's go. Yes, of 
course, dear. Sorry. Pastor. That's all the help  

7
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:38,840
I can be for now. I have a date with my favorite 
daughter. I'm your only daughter, Papa. Yes. Well,  

8
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,320
of course, that's right. Care for a paper this 
evening. Mayor. It's a special edition only two  

9
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,920
days to Christmas. You know. Thank you, Brigetta. 
Christmas news is always good news. Uh Keep the  

10
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,160
change. What I thank you, Mayor. It's got a bit 
of the Christmas spirit yourself. I see. I suppose  

11
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:16,920
I do. Brigetta, I suppose I do. Come father. 
Good evening, Carla. Could you use a hand with  

12
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,560
that? I surely could Brigetta. The village looks 
wonderful. Everyone seems to be decorating this  

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:45,800
year. Everyone except, ah, yes, poor, lonely Hans. 
It's the same every year. Mhm Mhm... Good evening  

14
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Hans.Christmas is coming soon, or? Haven't you 
noticed? The quicker it comes, the quicker it can  

15
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:03,400
be over and done with? My goodness, Hans. I don't 
understand why you hate Christmas so much? . and  

16
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,480
I do not understand why you love Christmas 
so much ? . So that makes us even. I love  

17
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,960
everything about it. Lighting the advent candles, 
the holiday food, the church celebrations,  

18
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:20,240
the joyful Christmas spirit in the village. I even 
love buying Christmas presents for my family. This  

19
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,440
year. I'm buying my wife a warm winter coat 
and my daughter has a list a mile long. Well,  

20
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,840
I have no family.Don't you have something better 
to do than to sit around here soaking up all my  

21
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,600
heat. You do not have to be rude, Hans. I can 
take a hint. It was not a hint. All right,  

22
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm leaving. I'm leaving. yeah.And what do you 
want? Are you here for a Christmas handout too?  

23
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:10,880
Well, do not bother Aldo Christmas is just another 
excuse to be greedy and I will not be part of it.  

24
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,399
What? Who is there? Care for a newspaper? Hans. I 
have one left. Can you not see I have work to do.  

25
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:23,680
I do not have time to read a newspaper. The bakery 
has the most wonderful sweet cakes. You should buy  

26
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,720
one to serve to your Christmas guests. You know, 
as well as I do that. No one ever visits me. Not  

27
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,800
now and certainly not at Christmas each year. 
I keep hoping things will change for you. Hans.  

28
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:53,840
I truly hope you have a Merry Christmas. Anyway. 
What do you know? You're just a stupid bird. Now,  

29
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,360
what, what do you want? Is that any way to greet 
your mayor? Shoemaker? I'm very sorry, your honor.  

30
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I thought you were that old woman. What I did not 
mean to say that you were an old woman. I mean,  

31
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:15,320
you are certainly not old, never mind all that. We 
are here on the most important business, Mr Mayor.  

32
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,680
How may I be of service? I am searching for the 
perfect Christmas gift for my darling Adelaide.  

33
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,000
I doubt that we will find such a gift here, Papa. 
Nevertheless, we must look at all possibilities.  

34
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,720
Show us your finest ware shoemaker. I'm sorry, Mr 
Mayor. But I've not made a new pair of shoes for  

35
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,920
quite some time. Most of my business is repairing 
old shoes for the people of the village. Come,  

36
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:49,360
Papa. We're wasting our time here. You see, Aldo, 
now, I have lost a sale. You are right. Aldo,  

37
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,680
I should have offered to make a pair of shoes for 
the mayor's daughter with that fine red leather I  

38
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,320
have been saving, but it's too late now the mayor 
will find his gift somewhere else. The mayor, he's  

39
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:09,320
back, Mr Mayor. I am so glad you came back. Good 
evening, Hans. Oh, it is only you, Gretchen. Yes,  

40
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:17,640
it is only me. But today I have business for you. 
What is this? Can you believe it? Hans. Someone  

41
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,240
threw away these perfectly good shoes. These 
shoes belong in the trash. They're hopeless. Oh,  

42
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,840
I was hoping you could work your magic on them. 
Oh, I want to have them cut down and repaired for  

43
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,640
my granddaughter Elsa. They will be her Christmas 
present. It would take no less than a miracle to  

44
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:45,280
repair these shoes. But I can pay. pay.?? What 
can you pay? Gretchen? .This is the finest bundle  

45
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,200
I have. I was saving it for Elsa and myself, but 
I would like you to have it. Twiggs won't buy my  

46
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:00,360
supper. You know that please Hans. I know a bundle 
of twigs is not much payment for your fine work,  

47
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:11,320
but it is all I have and gift. I was hoping to 
appeal to your Christmas spirit. Christmas spirit  

48
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,640
more like greedy spirit. You mean everyone is so 
worried about Christmas gifts. No one has ever  

49
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:24,000
given me a gift and especially not at Christmas. 
Hes I'm surprised at you. Christmas is about more  

50
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,080
than presents. Not from what I see. Gifts at 
Christmas are a symbol of the celebration of  

51
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,000
God's great gift. See nothing but gifts but 
Hans. God gave us the gift of his son Jesus  

52
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,240
Christ. Born in Bethlehem to be the savior of 
the world. Isn't that worth celebrating? Well,  

53
00:07:45,240 --> 00:08:20,080
yes but well, good night Hans. Hans, who are you? 
What do you want? Do not be afraid I bring you  

54
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,040
good news. This cannot be happening. Is this, 
I mean, are you a real Hans? You can be happy  

55
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,919
that Christmas is coming this year? Not you two. 
This must be a nightmare for on this Christmas  

56
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:39,639
you will receive a special gift. No one would 
be silly enough to buy me a gift. I hate gifts.  

57
00:08:39,640 --> 00:09:09,240
This gift will be above all others. It will be a 
gift from God. A gift from God to me. yeah.morning  

58
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,680
Frederick. Good morning Brigetta. Where do they 
sell the finest gifts in the village? I must buy a  

59
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,680
present for someone very special. Well, how about 
the bookbinder right across the street? Thank you,  

60
00:09:23,680 --> 00:10:01,080
Brigetta. Wonderful idea. Ah, good day Hans. How 
nice to see you out and about. But what can I do  

61
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,160
for you? I must have the very best gift in your 
shop. Gustav. Oh, how about this lovely painting?  

62
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,080
One of a kind, you know? No, no, no. It's nice. 
But I must have your very best. This sculpture  

63
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:20,560
is perfect. Seems to be real. Does it not? Oh, 
I think I've seen it somewhere before. Don't you  

64
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,840
have something different? Something beautiful? And 
exciting and, and special come Hans. I have just  

65
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:51,600
the thing, but that's just a simple box. You think 
so? Watch this? It, it, it's amazing. Papa. Look,  

66
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,040
Mr Mayor Adelaide. How lovely to see you, Gustav. 
What is this? Why it is? That is my gift. Papa.  

67
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,520
I want that music box. No, wait, I want to buy 
it here, Gustav. You can have all of my money,  

68
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:14,800
whatever he has. Gustav, I will pay more. But, 
but sorry, Hans. Oh, Papa. How about one of  

69
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,760
these other music boxes? Hans this one is nice. 
You don't understand Gustav. It must be the very  

70
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:35,960
best. I will keep looking. Please let me help 
you with that. Gretchen. You like to exchange  

71
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,520
gifts at Christmas, don't you? Yes. If they are 
given in the right spirit. Well, what gift would  

72
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:48,440
you give to someone very special? Oh, that depends 
on who it is. Well, it is God actually. What would  

73
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,520
you give to God for Christmas? I would give him 
what I give him every day, my sins for his Pardon,  

74
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,160
My weakness for his strength, my sorrow, for 
his joy. Well, that is not exactly what I had  

75
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:12,440
in mind. Think about it. Hans ponder it in your 
heart. You will know what to do . Thank you,  

76
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:47,400
Gretchen Elsa. You have saved the day. By the way, 
Merry Christmas, Aldo my friend,I was hoping you  

77
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:59,440
would come today. You're right. Aldo. It's been 
too long since I've sung a Christmas song. I'll  

78
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,200
tell you a little secret. I have forgotten some 
of the words. But at Christmas, who cares just as  

79
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:16,000
long as we sing. Take a look. My friend. This 
is the finest leather in the land. I've saved  

80
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
it for many years for just such an occasion. I 
know it is small but it is the best. I will make  

81
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,760
something wonderful with it. Silver nails, all 
handmade by my father. And these silver bells  

82
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:39,560
are from my very first Christmas tree. They make 
me so happy. I'm making a gift. Aldo a Christmas  

83
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:46,400
gift. I know what you're thinking. But I've been 
told that this year I will receive a gift, a very  

84
00:13:46,400 --> 00:14:12,320
special gift and I must have one just as special 
to give in return. I wonder what Hans is doing  

85
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:21,960
in there. I hear he's making a gift for a king. 
Oh, my a king. shhʃʃʃ . I am nearly finished. You  

86
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:30,960

better than I'd hoped. I want everyone to see my  

87
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:44,240

what they are big. Make way, make way for the
